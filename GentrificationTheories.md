  root((Relevant theories, concepts, and perspectives of Gentrification))
    **An increased understanding of these theories will help us frame our project**
    Diappi and Bolchi's definition of Gentrification - 2006
      "a spontaneous process of revitalisation and redevelopment of a central neightbourhood, which provokes a rise in residential property price and hence a population turn-over in favour of middle-upper classes." p.6
           The "physical upward changes concern old lower class neighbourhoods and industrial districts."
         The "rising quality of buildings and urban surroundings results in a social shift, attracting people who are younger, cultured and affluent enough to pay continually increasing prices."
           Students can oftentimes be relied upon to pay such increases as they can short-term borrow from parents/ family and use student loans. Yet, this does not undermine the fact that they are being exploited and can suffer exploitative landlord practices
             Relation to poor and unethical landlord practices
     Gentrification phenomenon does not occur piecemeal- it "affects whole urban districts" and results from "many individual decisions interacting and cooperating for mutual advantage" p.6-7
     What is the mechanism behind gentrification? p.7
           2 approaches: "cultural phenomenon driven by demand" adopted by urban geographer and sociologist perspectives- a "return of middle socio-econmic classes" from isolated housing in the suburbs to lively city, or, "new middle glass emerging in the transition from industrial to post-industrial city"
    **Rent Gap Theory** by Marxist economist, Smith - 1979
        Adopts supply approach of gentrification driven by demand. "It is capital, given appropriate conditions, which finds it  worth  investing in decayed urban areas, due to the potential gains from substantial increases is land rent and land value; population turnover represents a physiological consequence of the process." Idea that there is a life cycle to a building and once it decays it needs revitalisation via reinvestment- Diapi and Bolchi, 2006, p.7
       The **Gap Theory**= gap created between the current and expected rent after rehabilitation- Diapi and Bolchi, 2006, p.6-7
          This idea of rent value based off practical/ impractical land use has been debated eg. Bourassa argues rent has a value based off the land's highest and best use, not poor use to good use- 1933
            This idea critqiued by Clark, stating rent can be affected by land use- 1995
              Clark successfully tested Smith's RGT - 1987
       Smith's conceptualisation differs to other economists. Smith's property investment/ disinvestment cycle in relation to rent dynamic of the building- explained by Diapi and Bolchi, 2006, p.8
        1st stage: "new construction and first cycle of use"- property deteriorates at hand of the homeowner or tenant
        2nd stage: "from homeowner to landlord"- when a property is let, the criteria for investing in maintenance change, and investment is only worthwhile if there is return in terms of rent
        3rd stage: as the rent of the property is determined by conditions of surrounding buildings, you get decay of whole neighbourhood. 
        4th stage: less investment in that area, more investment in more profitable areas. Rents and house values collapse, producing falls in property prices. Vandalism and crime accelarate process of degradation
        5th stage: property abandoned. The rent collapse "creates the economic conditioons for a rational market response: revaluation of the area through investment and consequent triggering of gentrification"
        This relates to Newcastle's 'post-industrial' town status
          Coincides with Smith's definition of capitalised rent as "the actual quantity of ground rent that is appropriated by the land owner, given the present land use" and potential rent as "the amount of rent that could be capitalised under the land's highest and best use." Smith, 1979, p.543
            There is a graph on p.544 showcasing the RGT
     RGT still holds strong today
