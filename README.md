# 1. What is Tenant Talk?
<br>

> **Tenant Talk** is a data advocacy and app campaign platform designed critically to support Newcastle upon Tyne's student tenant population, who can become vulnerable to exploitative, unethical, and legally problematic practices at the hands of their landlords and as a consequence of broader economical processes of gentrification
<br>


**Tenant Talk** has been produced to support, and has been thoroughly informed by, *Homes to Newcastle*'s two-fold campaigns. *Homes to Newcastle* requested a digital campaign tool that aims to...

The **Tenant Talk** app responds to these two central aims by working to:
<br>

1. Expose landlords who neglect their economic and legal responsibilities at their properties and/ or behave unethically towards their tenants, leaving tenants to suffer in unsafe, unpleasant, or temperamental living conditions. 
2. Reveal how landlords, acting in line with broader economical processes of gentrification, disproportionately increase the rent cost of their properties while students are living in these poor conditions. As gentrification occcurs in predominantly (or nearby) city centre areas, student tenants, who are bound to living in such city-centre residential areas for university, face no choice but to eventually consent to rent price increases at the end of their fixed tenancy period or live elsewhere. However, oftentimes tenants can prematurely or erronously agree to rent price increases because they are not empowered with a full understanding of their rights as tenant to dispute this matter (more detail on this later).
<br>

**Tenant Talk** recognises that both of these contentions force tenants **unwillingly** and **unreasonably** into acute, fragile, and subjugated socio-economic positions. Student tenants are the most severe victims in the renting market, which is contemporarily compounded by the cost of living crisis. Landlords ultimately face no fatal economic struggle as they can increasing the rents of their property(s). This means that landlords occupy hegemonic socio-economic stances over students, who inevitably face paying these higher rents and equally suffer the lived experience of less money being invested into the general maintenance of their rented property (Socialist Worker, 2023). According to Shelter, one in two private renters in England (of some "3.2 million adults") would be unable to pay ther rent in the event of losing their job, and 2.2 million renters would be unable to pay their rent in the same circumstances even with the inclusion of their savings (2023). For students, whom are unable to partake in full time employment due to their university commitments, the economic situation is made ever-more fragile.
<br>

## Student Tenants
We decided to narrow the focus of our project to student tenants, although this does not mean to exclude other types of tenants from engaging with and benefitting from our app. This decision was unanimously made given that we are student renters ourselves and our social networks also usefully contain fellow student tenants. Hence, collectively as creators, we have first hand experience with and access to further insight regarding the social, economic, and political issues stipulated by the brief. 
<br>

Tenant Talk has been crafted for Rugg, Ford and Burrows' third characterised student renting pathway, the "*constrained pathway*" (2006). This incorporates a typology of students who experience relatively severe to severe constraints in the renting/ housing market. These are students who are moving out of their family homes and into (preferred) city centre areas and in the process struggle to source affordable properties to live in due to the increased gentrification of areas. Given that students are unable to commit to full-time employment, and are increasingly facing no choice but to work part-time (Wright, 2024), these students often have "protracted stays" in their parental homes, if possible, or they may have some family support which could be relied upon in terms of economic harship for paying their rent (Rugg, Ford and Burrows, 2006, p.29). However, this typology of students will inevitably lack sufficient enough incomes to afford their rent, placing them as the most- and crucially, involuntarily so- constrained in the housing markets.
<br>

Given the semantic terminology of the brief implies a necessity to "expose" and "reveal", we decided that this agenda lended itself usefully to data advocacy approaches. We therefore, through **Tenant Talk**, aim to make visible the implications of unethical landlord treatment of tenants and economic gentrification on student tenants (see section 4 for more detail), whilst adhering in line with data protection standards (see section 7 for more detail). For our team, this meant creating three-fold approach to our app's components.

Moreover, 

## Tenant Talk app features:
1. **Tenant Tales**: an interactive map with embedded qualitatve and quantitative data student tenants but also by student tenants.

2. **Tenant Handbook**

3. **Tenant Round-Up**

# 2. Critical Reflection on the Context of Our Project
<br>

## Our Survey 
(Tenant Talk, 2024)
- survey
- student grassroot campaigns
## The Student Housing Crisis
Student maintenance loans are falling short of their function to support student living, with the loan being "almost entirely wiped out by rent alone" (Weale, 2023).

# 3. Existing Projects

# 4. TenantTalk's Framing Devices
-application of and developed an understanding of critical theories and concepts
<br>

# 5. Project Design Process and Reflections
<br>
Initial ideas we had for our project were rather distant to the final prototype. Our first ideas centred around a complaints management system

# 6. Challenges we Faced and how we attempted to Overcome them
- ethical challenges
- technical challenges
- design challenges
  <br>

# 7. Reflection on the hypothetical 'real-life' implication of TenantTalk
<br>

# 8. Our Digital Approach
Digital- what has tech tools allowed us to do/ has allowed us to respond to the brief in a specific way 
<br>
