### About this project
_This is the beginning of our project. We will be populating this read.me file as we go along._

Ethical questions surrounding the legal frameworks of using data:

  1. Transparancy: Need to let every students or immigrants and landlords realize the detailed information we have, the data need to be fully Transparant.

     To the users: eg. Maybe just embed the website of every apartment. 

     To the landlords: eg. Contact the lanlord and let them know the intension and let them agree. 

  2. Accountability: There should be a public accountability for both landlords and users. 

     To the users: eg. Commentary area, Report Button, Customer Service, Clarification of Responsibilities.

     To the landlords: eg. Make sure the landlords can keep contact with app owner (The app we designed) in case there are any misinformation about them. 

  3. Fairness: There should not have any discrimination problems. 

     To the landlords: eg. Our aim is to pick out the bad landlords. But we cannot have any partial words using in our app. 

  4. Data Safety (Maybe hard to present in adobe XD) 

     To the users and landlords: Should protect the data of both users and landlords.
