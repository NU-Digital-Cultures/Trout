# 1. What is Tenant Talk?

> **Tenant Talk** is a data advocacy and app campaign platform designed critically to support Newcastle upon Tyne's student tenant population, who can become vulnerable to exploitative, unethical, and legally problematic practices at the hands of their landlords and as a consequence of broader economical processes of gentrification
<br>


**Tenant Talk** has been produced to support, and has been thoroughly informed by, *Homes to Newcastle*'s two-fold campaigns. *Homes to Newcastle* requested a digital campaign tool that aims to...

<img width="985" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 15 29 43" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/a4cb3b08-59ce-4096-9ae1-5725cea71617">

The **Tenant Talk** app responds to these two central aims by working to:
<br>

1. Expose landlords who neglect their economic and legal responsibilities at their properties and/ or behave unethically towards their tenants, leaving tenants to suffer in unsafe, unpleasant, or temperamental living conditions. 
2. Reveal how landlords, acting in line with broader economical processes of gentrification, disproportionately increase the rent cost of their properties while students are living in these poor conditions. As gentrification occcurs in predominantly (or nearby) city centre areas, student tenants, who are bound to living in such city-centre residential areas for university, face no choice but to eventually consent to rent price increases at the end of their fixed tenancy period or live elsewhere. However, oftentimes tenants can prematurely or erronously agree to rent price increases because they are not empowered with a full understanding of their rights as tenant to dispute this matter (more detail on this later).
<br>

**Tenant Talk** recognises that both of these contentions force tenants **unwillingly** and **unreasonably** into acute, fragile, and subjugated socio-economic positions. Student tenants are the most severe victims in the renting market, which is contemporarily compounded by the cost of living crisis. Landlords ultimately face no fatal economic struggle as they can increasing the rents of their property(s). This means that landlords occupy hegemonic socio-economic stances over students, who inevitably face paying these higher rents and equally suffer the lived experience of less money being invested into the general maintenance of their rented property (Socialist Worker, 2023). According to Shelter, one in two private renters in England (of some "3.2 million adults") would be unable to pay ther rent in the event of losing their job, and 2.2 million renters would be unable to pay their rent in the same circumstances even with the inclusion of their savings (2023). For students, whom are unable to partake in full time employment due to their university commitments, the economic situation is made ever-more fragile.
<br>

## Student Tenants
We decided to narrow the focus of our project to student tenants, although this does not mean to exclude other types of tenants from engaging with and benefitting from our app. This decision was unanimously made given that we are student renters ourselves and our social networks also usefully contain fellow student tenants. Hence, collectively as creators, we have first hand experience with and access to further insight regarding the social, economic, and political issues stipulated by the brief. 
<br>

Tenant Talk has been crafted for Rugg, Ford and Burrows' third characterised student renting pathway, the "*constrained pathway*" (2006). This incorporates a typology of students who experience relatively severe to severe constraints in the renting/ housing market. These are students who are moving out of their family homes and into (preferred) city centre areas and in the process struggle to source affordable properties to live in due to the increased gentrification of areas. Given that students are unable to commit to full-time employment, and are increasingly facing no choice but to work part-time (Wright, 2024), these students often have "protracted stays" in their parental homes, if possible, or they may have some family support which could be relied upon in terms of economic harship for paying their rent (Rugg, Ford and Burrows, 2006, p.29). However, this typology of students will inevitably lack sufficient enough incomes to afford their rent, placing them as the most- and crucially, involuntarily so- constrained in the housing markets.
<br>

Given the semantic terminology of the brief implies a necessity to "expose" and "reveal", we decided that this agenda lended itself usefully to data advocacy approaches. We therefore, through **Tenant Talk**, aim to make visible both the implications of unethical landlord treatment and economic gentrification on student tenants (see section 4 for more detail), whilst adhering in line with data protection standards (see section 7 for more detail). For our team, such a wide-ranging agenda meant creating a more complex, three-fold approach to our app's components: a **Tenant Tales** interactive map, a **Tenant Handbook**, and a **Tenant Roundup** section. 
<br>

## This is the opening page of our app:

<img width="249" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 16 18 34" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/16b47a48-d81b-4311-8e4b-68cb75232ddd">
<br>

## Our app features explained:
1. The **Tenant Tales** portion of our app consists of an interactive map which is embedded with both qualitative and quantitative data. Our qualitative data exists in the form of tenants' personal stories and experiences of renting. These are uploaded onto the map according to the different areas (specificially, electoral ward boundaries) of Newcastle. Our quantitative data consists of a rent cost analysis organised by the same area criteria as the qualitative data of Newcastle. In essence, the **Tenant Tales** map addresses the empowerment element of the brief: it fosters a shared student identity space where student experiences of renting hold value and can be creatively articulated. Our penultimate idea for this section was that the map would become a supportive hub of qualitative landlord/ area data for student tenants and created by student tenants, which is then interweaved seamlessly with further supportive data indicitative of gentrification levels in specific areas. 
  <br>
  
2. The **Tenant Handbook** presents as an interactive, almost 'cartoon-like' walkthrough of a tenancy. It is focussed upon matters that were evidenced as problematic by student tenants in our Tenant Talk Survey (2024). The **Handbook** visually replicates the inside image of the house that is on our app's opening page. As users navigate the different sections of the house, each item in different rooms correlates to a piece of information that is vital for student tenants to know (and that they had stipulated in our Survey (2024) they would want to know)) about their tenant or landlord's rights and responsibilities within and about the property they are renting. The **Handbook** specifically focusses on the following points of contention for student tenants:
- Disputes processes
- Rent price increasing during a tenancy
- Deposit protection schemes and eventual return
- Property maintenance and repairs
- Tenant safety
- Unjust fees and charges
- No-fault evictions
 <br>

The **Tenant Handbook** fundamentally empowers tenants with the knowledge, tools, and feeling of social capital (Bourdieu, 1984)/ power to navigate the renting market and their tenancies by being incredibly informative and advisory of the best approaches to navigating difficult renting situations or troublesome landlords. It empowers students to make well-founded demands for a safe, stable, and good quality housing by acting as a vital and easy to comprehend 'what to do' student digital pocket handbook for renting.
<br>
 
 3. **The Tenant Round-up** operates as a centralised news hub within the application. Its purpose is to meet the users’ requirements for current and relevant news articles. This feature also promotes a community atmosphere by enabling discussions among users about the news stories, thereby keeping users informed about situations of interest.<br>

The user interface of this feature is arranged in a series of tiles, with each tile representing a unique news story. Each tile displays an image that corresponds to the story’s content and is accompanied by the story’s title. This layout allows users to navigate through the news articles with ease and select the ones that capture their interest.
When a user selects a tile, they are presented with a concise summary of the news report, providing a quick overview of the story. For users interested in more in-depth information, a link to the original source of the information is provided at the bottom of the screen. This ensures that users can access the full content if they wish to explore the story further.
<br>

The **Tenant Round-up** is an extension of the principles outlined when developing **Tenant Handbook**. It emphasizes the fundamental concept that knowledge equips individuals with the power to navigate housing matters effectively and to challenge substandard landlords. In addition, the implementation of the comment section serves to cultivate a sense of community among users. As Katt Deaven (2020) articulates, “News comment sections give readers opportunities to interact, to discuss stories, and to learn from each other.” This statement underscores the importance of interactive platforms in fostering community engagement and shared learning experiences.

<br>

The significance of our three app components are discussed thoroughly in section 5. 
<br>

# 2. Existing Projects
<br>

One of the first steps in our project process was outlining what projects already exist which aim to tackle similar issues as *Homes to Newcastle*. This step was taken in order to see if we could take any inspiration from other projects, to get a sense of what exists and is useful/ not useful, and if it was possible to find a gap in existing project strategies which we could exploit and use in our project. This task was undertaken [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/ExistingProjectEvaluation.docx).

This research led us to the formation of our [problem statement](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Direction/OurProblemStatement.md). However, by this point, we had also considered various framing devices that we wanted to adopt (see section 3).
<br>

Ultimately, we wanted to build upon what the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project achieves in their 'Tenants Rise Up!' section, which is using a combinaton approach of qualitative data to supplement qualitative, in order to fully capture the tenant experience. We felt that the use of qualitative data provided an essential 'community spirit' dimension to the project, which aligned succinctly with the consideration that this is a campaign project, which, fundamentally, although Tenant Talk is a city-based campaign, is still optimally encapsulated by the "individual-level networks that traverse them" (Breen and Eilstrup-Sangiovanni, 2023). This approach also bolstered our framing device of a digital zine, as zines have been historically created by "socially-outcasted" marginalised communities as a creative outlet for the expression of community issues and as a means for manufacturing an unique community identity (Heins, 2022, para.2-3). Section 4 provides more detail on this.

# 3. Critical Reflection on the Context of Our Project
Tenant Talk is situated within contextual critical theories, concepts, and knowledge to do with student renting.
<br>

## Gentrification
### What is Gentrification?
To grasp the mechanisms behind gentrification, we looked at [scholarly theorisations of gentrification](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Gentrification/GentrificationTheories.md). We found the Rental Gap Theory (RGT) the most persuasive for how understanding how it impacts tenants' rents. We applied this concept into our app by thinking of how we could best represent this gentrification process and the consequences it has for tenants in the form of data. This was done in our [GentrificationAsData](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Direction/GentrificationAsData.md) file. 
<br>

### Gentrification in Newcastle
We undertook narrower research to understand the unique consequences of [gentrification in Newcastle](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Gentrification/GentrificationInNewcastle.md) specifically.
<br>

Moreover, we created some data visualisations in order to understand the data narratives gentrification in the wider North East region.
<br>

**This data visualisation showcases a complex view of rental price increases over time, in relation to monthly and annual price change rates**
 - https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17544774/embed
 - General upward trend with regular peaks and troughs. However, there was more of a rapid rent increase trend from April 2022, reaching a peak in January 2023 (which is the most currrently available data)
 - This showcases the severity of rent increases in the North East for tenants
 - Again, highest annual change rate in rent increase in 2023 
<br>

**This data visualisation highlights differences in increased rental costs based on renting property type**
- https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17545301/embed
- Relatively similar increases in one/ two/ three bed properties
- Steeper increase in four (or more) properties- **students are more likely to house share** and therefore rent these properties
 <br>

**This data visualisation demonstrates the average household expenditure in the UK by the end of 2022**
- https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/17729763/
- Housing, fuel, and power is the highest expenditure category (87.7%) which explicitly points to Tenant Talk the severity of the housing crisis for tenants as it is on average the highest outgoing category for households
<br>

> All of this data is sourced from ONS: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/priceindexofprivaterentsukmonthlypricestatistics 
<br>

> The csv files of the first two visualisations were filtered to show specific data types and data for the **North East** region only.
<br>

## Student Renting and the Student Housing Crisis
Our broad research on the overall student renting experience, current student grassroots campaigns, key debates in student renting, and some recent updates in the renting market and student housing crisis can be found [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/StudentTenants/StudentRenting.md).
<br>

These contextual considerations are applied to the Tenant Talk app as they provide the ground content for facilitating our understanding of the struggles student tenans face. This understanding informed us of what our app should set out to achieve and how it can best support student tenants in the contemporary, ever-changing renting market.
<br>

The student renting experience is considered and theorised more deeply in section 4 (and in relation to our project's framing devices).
<br>

## Our Research Method: Our Survey (Tenant Talk, 2024)
Information regarding the process our survey (2024) can be found [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Research%20Methods/Survey.md).
<br>

The results of our survey were used to inform the production of our app, in that the responses we received were:
1. Abstract, various, and (some were) emotionally charged. This told us that, and validated our idea of, including a wider variety of forms for the tenant submissions 
2. Pointing to specific issues such as what they would have liked to know before they rented their property, repairs problems, challenging experiences with landlords, and the unaffordability of bills/ rent increases etc. This led us to the idea of creating the Tenant Handbook: an essential guide of for students' rights, responsibilities, and informing students on how to navigate unchartered territory in the renting/ housing markets.
3. Used to create our [example tenant tales submissions](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Research%20Methods/TenantTales.md).
<br>

# 4. Tenant Talk's Framing Devices
In order to achieve *Homes to Newcastle*'s aims, we decided on two major critical framing devices that would uniquely shape our project, which are briefly summarised below. These devices mostly steer the creative direction of our **Tenant Tales** interactive map, however, the principles underpinning them are carried over to all three of our app sections.
<br>

## 1. Digital Storytelling 
- We considered a digital storytelling approach through the lens of academic research, which is presented in our [mermaid map](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling/DigitalStorytellingResearch.md).
- We chose digital storytelling as we found that it provided a unique way into aligning with Foucault's 'technologies of the self' (Landby, 2008b), that is, the materialist view that through users' interaction with and consequent self-regulation through digital technologies, modern subjects and groups can become to define themselves and their identities through such technologies (Foucault, 1988). Therefore, through digital storytelling, we can facilitate through our platform a space whereby tenant subjects can somewhat free themselves from the current harsh realities  of their renting situations or constraints experienced in the renting market, by permitting tenants to redefine and subverte their current situations onto their own terms on our app. Our initial take and readings on identity, community, and vernacular formation is [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/TenantTalkIdentity.md). Our aim was to create a collective tenant identity on our platform which intersects in tandem with our contemporary media-saturated society.
- However, one of the main ethical issues we felt we would have to contend with is the "danger of appropriating someone else's story if they are not given control at all moments" (Dush, 2012, p.631). This entails that, as our platform is acting as a sponsor for tenants' personal stories, the platform which we created for story submissions will ultimately dictate the form, content, and parameters of the stories. This idea also encapsulates McLuhan's cornerstone claim that the 'medium is the message' (McLuhan, 2001)​, that is, the way in which we present the stories will determine and potentially restricg how they are conveyed to other users. To somehwhat overcome this ethical and technical dilemma, we decided to adopt zines as a second framing device (see '2. Zine Culture').
<br>

## 1 continued. (Non-Linear & Interactive) Digital Storytelling 
- We also conducted further research into [non-linear and interactive storytelling](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling/InteractiveNonLinearStorytelling.md). This consisted of researching storytelling approaches that we could take inspiration from, from which would develop our own digital storytelling approach. Here we also interrogated the potential ethical, political, and social implications of interactive storytelling.
- Here is our [non-linear storytelling visual](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling/NonLinearStorytellingVisual.md), the non-linear torytelling theory that we used to underpin our **Tenant Tales** interactive map.
<br>

➕

## 2. Zine Culture
- We first interrogated the idea of incorporating zine principles and aesthetics, but in a digital format, in this [mermaid map](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/main/Project%20Research/ZineCulture.md).
- For us, the meaning of incorporating zine ideas was to ensure that our tenant submissions were not confined or shaped by our app in any way. Zine entries are in flexible formats and we wanted our submissions to be self-published, self-determined, reflective, and critical narratives.
- Our zine approach is justified in that it has been argued that the cultural impact of zines would be greater now than in our modern technological age (Heins, 2022). The fact that we are using a digital tool to convey a zine permits it greater reach and levels of interactivity with users. This will provide Tenant Talk with more effective and/ or novel ways of capturing tenant experiences- also capturing them more widely- and producing identity. 
<br>

🟰

## Pulling these framing devices together and considering them relational to student renting/ housing conversations :warning:
- Ultimately, there are a deeper set of stuctural and interpersonal relationships at play in the student renting market. 
- Applying Foucault's 'technologies of the self' more broadly, student tenants not only shape their identities through self-disciplining technologies, but through this practice, can be empowered to actively participate in shaping their living environment (and renting realities). In this way, our first digital tool (**Tenant Tales**) offers students a way to change the power dynamics at play in their own unique living spaces. The fact that tenant submissions are uploaded and organised by area further promotes this agenda for student tenants. Our second tool (the **Tenant Handbook**) address the information asymmetry between of landlord-tenants, whereby landlords are empowered with knowledge where students may be new to the renting market and possess naive perspectives (ADD THE REFERENCE TO THIS). Therefore, our **Handbook** offers an alternative approach to finding the best price for accomodation on our **Tenant Tales** map. The Handbook approach can change this inequal set of power relationships (FINISH THIS)
- The **Tenant Round-Up** tool (FINISH THIS)
- - What is special about the case of student tenants- landlord structures and how our tool works in that context
<br>

# 5. Project Design Process and Reflections
## Development of Ideas and Our Collaborative Process
Initial ideas that we had for our project were rather distant to the final prototype. Our first ideas centred around a creating a sort of informal 'complaints management' system or an Uber-like rating system of landlords. 
<br>

Ultimately, we did not go with these ideas in the end, however they are discussed and debunked in our [key project decisions](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/KeyProjectDecisions.md) table which we used throughout the project to up-keep with our decision-making process and design process.
<br>

These decisions were made in relation to our group discussions which are captured on our [meeting log](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/main/Project%20Management/MeetingLog.md).
<br>

Over time, we updated this [flow diagram](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Direction/ScopeOfProject.md) to capture the full scope of our project. 
<br>

Alongside discussions with eachother and the creation of offline and online ['to-do' lists](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/Updated%20to%20do%20list.md), we more formally documented our individual taks using a Gantt chart as a [project timeline](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/ProjectTimeline.md). 
<br> 

## Tenant Talk's Design Process
> **Note**: This section is presented with the iterations that we created in chronological order, however different iteration numbers are given to the **Tenant Tales** map, the Tenant Talk opening app page, the **Tenant Handbook**, and the **Tenant Round-Up**.
<br>

The project started with a very basic paper prototype when we were intially brainstorming ideas for our project.
<br>

### First iteration: A Paper Prototype of the Tenant Tales map (Soi)
![](https://github.com/soichiro331/soichiro331/blob/main/untitled%20folder%202/IMG_9597.JPG)
- This is the rough paper prototype we created around our 4th week after we had interrogated existing projects.
- The main idea we gathered from this stage was the importance of non-linear storytelling, which we specifically thought we should capture within an interactive map which would include markers, with stories attached to each marker point.
- At this stage, the idea of a 'Tenant Round-Up' had not come about, and therefore we conceptualised the map as being just full of qualitative data including submissions and news updates/ stories on renting. This idea was eventually discarded we realised there was no real benefit to having news stories organised by location and overcrowded the map visually/ the map felt like it had lost its sense of purpose.
- This prototype also showcases our humanization aim of our design process (compared to pre-existing products which are more like manuals).
<br>

Once we had settled on a somewhat stable idea for our app, we began designing the first opening app page: its visuals, aesthetics, and technical use functions.
 <br>

### First iteration: the Tenant Talk opening app page (Troy and Ethan)
![](https://github.com/soichiro331/soichiro331/blob/main/untitled%20folder%202/Screenshot%202024-04-27%20at%2023.01.40.png)
- The issue we had with this design was the inconsistency of the visual style. The team agreed that this aesthetic of the app was visually heavy, and so a more basic design was favoured to allow greater focus on the content of the app. 
- This iteration of design has the general flow of the app, but is still linear in nature which conflicts with our focus on non-linear narrative (this is overcome in our second iteraction)
- There are aesthetic choices such as the scrapped paper which may add on to the zine aesthetic, however the specific choice of this image feels very 2D for a digital zine and does not do much to convey our app's agenda. Our visuals need to be more related to the brief's empowerment aims.
<br>

### Second iteration: the Tenant Talk opening app page (Blythe)
App loading page:
<br>

<img width="785" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 15 17 30" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/206817aa-fd6b-4636-858e-d70339429686">
<br>

- The blue colour scheme serves more of a purpose compared to the scrumpled paper as it conveys the app has a more formal agenda/ direction
<br>

<br>

App log-in page:
<br>

<img width="791" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 15 18 36" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/d70f7863-4083-40c4-adeb-4e4e333ed497">
<br>

<br>

App opening page:
<br>

<img width="769" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 15 21 22" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/e67258eb-6e90-494f-b380-b7f21d44adb1">
<br>

<br>

Subsequent linking pages from the opening page:
<br>

<img width="311" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 15 25 13" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/2a2300cf-a046-43d6-a679-66dff68c7807">
<br>

<br>

<img width="307" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 15 26 17" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/a78fbf7c-43d8-4e64-802c-53de501afe46">
<br>

(^ also, this is technically a **first iteration** of the Tenant Handbook and where the idea was first born)
<br>

- We preferred this design over the first iteration, however it still felt quite visually heavy and acted in line with commercial and conventional app aesthetics. Considering we are aiming for a 'digital zine' format, we thought we should reconsider the idea of having a clear/ standard menu system
- Another problem we found was that the four options on the app opening page were overlapping in function and we felt that the potential content of these sections would be descriptive and dull, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid. We decided narrow the options down to three in the next prototype: 'Tenant Tales', Tenant Handbook', and 'Tenant Roundup.'
- These will instead be presented incorporated into a 'magazine-like' front cover, with the idea that we are subverting the purpose of a magazine for a non-conventional target audience and community-based cause. The buttons leading to the three app sections should not look like conventional buttons and the images on the opening page should convey in some form the tenant renting market
<br>

### Third (and final) iteration: the Tenant Talk opening app page (Soi and Blythe)
The final iteraction is based on the following mood board:
<br>

<img width="533" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 48 06" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/0cfde864-0935-4213-84d1-6017dfc02347">
<br>

<br>

<img width="512" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 15 41 57" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/b17f16e7-a262-4791-92ce-873f7e379655">
<br>

We felt that this version had finally captured our app aims and vision. 
<br> 

### Second iteration: the Tenant Tales Map (Blythe)
<img width="783" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 15 23 11" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/9bf242dd-2d0b-44cd-9c70-7c02c0e6cd0a">
<br>

- Conceptually, this is what we first envisioned the tenant submissions could be: a 'pop-up' book when clicked on (from on the Tenant Tales map)
<br>

### Third iteration: the Tenant Tales Map (https://www.figma.com/file/6Y7hizZOSErAj3zDalIT5Y/Figma-basics-(Ver.1)?type=design&node-id=1669%3A162202&mode=design&t=Sz3zlXzsMFR6kjmj-1) (Soi)
![](https://github.com/soichiro331/soichiro331/blob/main/untitled%20folder%202/Screenshot%202024-05-09%20at%2019.51.04.png)
<br>

- The third iteration was also created in figma with the main focus of developing an actual layout for the digital zine
- One thing we kept from the early iterations of the Tenant Talk opening app page was the login system/ menu, as this was felt as necessary to for tenants to make submissions and creates a smooth process of us verifying the stories themselves (more on this in section 7).
-  At this point, our concern focussed on the technicalities of the map and how we could marry our coding capabilities with how we want to  organise space on the map. Fundamentally, we all agreed that the way we organise space should be a meaningful, or else there is no point in having a map.
- This [flow map](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/TenantTalkApp/InteractiveMapIdeas.md) documents this process, capturing some of the design ideas we eventually went with and those we did not (upon reflection of the purpose of our main or due to technical difficulties/ limitations).
- We floated ideas of a heat map, and even using our survey results (ie. what student tenants stipulated most as renting problems) as different filter options on our map. Again, the evaluation of these ideas were recorded on our [key project decisions](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/KeyProjectDecisions.md) file.
<br>

- For this iteration, I considered utilizing Marker Clusters to improve the visual simplicity when there are multiple points in the area. However this proved to be difficult for me to execute in javascript, and was therefore scrapped.
- I used a GeoJSON data from https://martinjc.github.io/UK-GeoJSON/ and used the “Westminster parliamentary wards” for the area representation as it balanced the simplicity and complexity of the area borders whilst still being relatively accurate to area labels, on publicly available maps. I found that the use of electoral ward boundaries also visually works well, with the points clustering together and apart smoothly whilst zooming in/ out. 
<br>

Following discussion of this prototype, we changed the fact of attributing tenant submissions to a particular property, instead attributing them more generally to an area, for reasons stipulated in our [key project decisions](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/KeyProjectDecisions.md).
<br>

### Fourth iteration: the Tenant Tales Map (https://nu-digital-cultures.github.io/Trout/TenantTalkApp/Map%20HTML/index.html)
![](https://github.com/soichiro331/soichiro331/blob/main/untitled%20folder%202/Screenshot%202024-05-07%20at%2011.27.02.png)
- This is a visual product which now throughly focuses on the humanisation of storytelling beyond just numerical rating systems. We aimed to do this more so through personal stories and experiences of renting from students, collected through tenant submissions which they would be able to do on the app in future iterations (hypothetical).
-  The main system revolves around the map as users who are planning to move close to the area, can look at certain points based on the experiences of other students, helping them to choose an area better suited for them.

<br>

### Second iteration: the Tenant Handbook 
- We thought the Handbook should carry over more of the digital zine/ 'cartoon-y' aesthetic.
<br>
This is the mood board we created:
<br>

<img width="889" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 14 46 38" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/d05f1890-8765-4eeb-ae8e-a8b0d254e24c">
<br>

We also considered zine designs of marginalised communities: https://eu.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/nation/2021/07/31/zines-have-long-history-communities-color/5387294001/) 
<br>

This led us to the idea of producing the Handbook in a magazine format. 
<br>

A short mock-up example is below.
<br>

📖
First article: **Student Renters: Optimal Candidates for Exploitation at the hand of their Landlords**
"Students living away from home for the purposes of studying at university embody a “constrained pathway” when navigating economic and housing market constraints (Rugg, Ford and Burrows, 2006). For many of us, long-term employment isn’t an option and this means that rent is already hard to pay, notwithstanding if our landlord wrongfully dictates additional cost burdens to our wallet. For many, this can look like refusing to replace household items like a kettle or lightbulb or even bigger items such as a washing machine. By refusing to replace these objects students are forced to live without, or pay new items that they shouldn’t be paying for. This also means that students could be living in poor conditions which could lead to health complications."
<br>

Second article: **Be aware of your (essential) Tenant Rights!**
<br>

Third article: **The G-word: Gentrification. What is it?**
"In a nutshell, what this means for us students is that rent prices are driven up unproportionally..." etc
📖

<br>

- Simply put, this Tenant Handbook to be an almost tongue-and-cheek combination of a renting guide and a first-person narrative expression of student tenants' problems. The idea was for it to be in a magazine-like format, with a catchy, commercial title. This idea was liked given that it allowed us to mockingly subvert the purpose of a traditionally commercial magazine for a community-based, political cause. Also, the ability to use shared personal pronouns "us" would work towards our collective identity formation aim, and the idea that we are writing an article parallels the storytelling approach of the Tenant Tales, just now in written format.
- Yet, this idea was reevaluated as it did not do much to avoid the 'information overload' problem we identified as troublesome in existing projects. All we had done by this approach was recreating the same information dump but through a more radical, advocacy lens.
<br>

### Third (and final) iteration: the Tenant Handbook (https://www.figma.com/proto/2I2GfgxQAwwokmIrc1A0Ha/TenantHandbook-Prototype?type=design&node-id=730-1303&t=BJbMM0HyC95CwbkS-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=1669%3A162202&starting-point-node-id=730%3A1162&mode=design)
For the final iteration, we undertook research into existing 'handbook-like' strategies and evaluated them. This research can be found [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/TenantHandbookIdeas.md), and based on our findings, we created a mock-up protoype showcasing how our Handbook might look and function:
<br>

<img width="1141" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 14 30 06" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/ca0376f2-ea68-4fd0-90a5-dfb22b930cc9">
<br>

<img width="1143" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 14 30 48" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/65e05a3f-b8d1-406d-9719-d3dcf730d506">
<br>

- The idea was that, when users click onto different visual aspects/ objects of the house, a pop up will appear informing them of their tenant responsibilities and rights related to that object
- We decided that this overcomes the difficulty that government websites implement, whereby they have loads of sections with information which feels like an overwhelming 'information dump'
<br>

This resulted in the final prototype: 
<br>

![](https://github.com/soichiro331/soichiro331/blob/main/untitled%20folder%202/Screenshot%202024-04-30%20at%2013.59.16.png)
<br>

The textual content of the Handbook can be found [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/TenantHandbookContent.md).
<br>

- This final prototype aligned with our goal for the tenant handbook to be about tenancy rights and laws which the tenants could reference and learn from not just through words, but through a digital, more interactive and intuitive presentation. It also met our aim to provide the most effective way of achieving the empowerment of tenants with the tools and knowledge that they need to navigate the renting market in that it is very basic and almost child-like, but is ultimately very easy for users to navigate and quickly find the information they need.
- Inspired by the mock-up prototype that Blythe made, I created a visually eye-catching and friendly design of a typical housing in Adobe illustrator, which I took to figma to develop a prototype. Each room has specific items that correlate with the information that students from our survey felt was important, and tenants can use this information according to their own personal needs or concerns.
<br>

### First iteration: the Tenant Round-Up (Troy and Ethan)
As the **Tenant Round-up** was the final part of the app to be designed, many of the previously mentioned challenges in terms of design were already identified and addressed. This facilitated a swift development of the User Interface (UI), particularly in relation to the colour scheme and the placement of buttons, necessitating only a single interaction.
Gordon & Gibbons (2022) stated that “A design will look unprofessional and lack polish when visual elements are used inconsistently or sporadically.” In alignment with their observations, the UI of the **Tenant Round-up** adhered to the same thematic consistency as the rest of the application. This ensured a uniform and professional appearance throughout the application.

![Tenant Round up](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/158190282/a15bb60a-4a80-441b-87e4-839b426de8d5)

<br>

### Final iteration of all 3 app components (https://www.figma.com/file/UmZ6oeoMOkU6QbWeR6pZTP/Tenant-Talk-(Ver.2)?type=design&mode=design&t=Sz3zlXzsMFR6kjmj-1) (Soi)
![](https://github.com/soichiro331/soichiro331/blob/main/untitled%20folder%202/Screenshot%202024-05-09%20at%2019.50.23.png)
For this iteration, I made some small tweaks in the design of the app / zine to professionalize the looks. Such as adding gradients to the background. and icons to the menu buttons for easier understanding. I've also added a more final representation of what the map would look like, with poems, and artworks that groups together as a collage which users can scroll. This was then merged with the Tenant Handbook and Tenant Roundup and connected via the prototype feature to replicate the full function of the app / zine conceptually.
<br>

This is the [html](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/tree/tenant-talk/TenantTalkApp/Map%20HTML) for our **map**.
<br>

# 6. Challenges we Faced and how we attempted to Overcome them
## Ethical challenges
As our initial idea of having tenant submissions on the **Tenant Tales** map attached to specific properties was rejected for ethical reasons, and we had instead justified the approach of organising tenant submissions as per general area, this then (still) led us to face further ethical difficulties in terms of balancing privacy concerns with the import of having tenant submissions spatially located by area. We felt that the anonymity of the submissions, although sorted according to area, could constrain the overall utility of our map. However, we realised there would ultimately still be advantages to this approach as it nevertheless permits *Homes to Newcastle* access to nuanced, in-depth, and broad qualitative data that they would not otherwise would not have. Moreover, having publicly available data for regions is useful 
<br>

## Technical challenges
We found that geospatial data can be rather limited in terms of accuracy of area boundaries, however we felt this was not a point of contention given the similarly broad and loose nature of our app submissions process; submissions just needed to be roughly organised per area for the purposes of clear visual understanding.

Furthermore, the submission process requires a server to receive and manage the data within the app which is hard to achieve and replicate with the knowledge in coding we have right now. Realistically this would be done through a combination of javascript and php, and hosted on a website which mobile users can either visit via their search engine so updates can be done easily. However, at this current stage the best option without developing a php page will be to manually collect survey data with word of mouth and manual update.
<br>

## Design challenges
<br>
One of the challenges we faced at the start of our design process was being too restricted with the idea of a zine. Whilst we did propose a digital zine from the start, we wanted to convey the community based and hand-made aesthetic and the message that holds in to our final product. This led us to experiment with a couple of designs, such as trying to draw the cover page and the logo with paper and pencil, as well as trying out digital collages with hints of analogue tastes with pngs of ripped paper to layer. At the end, we resolved this issue by changing our perspective on zines, and trying to grasp the essence of its strengths conceptually rather than with just aesthetics. This was done through a more interactive and user based app structure, such as the addition of user-generated artworks.
<br>
Another challenge we faced was visually clutter. The second iteration of our app design as shown in AppDesignProcess.md initially captured the concept of Newcastle with its photorealistic elements. However, discussion led us to conclude that going for a more minimalistic design may suit the app at the end as it is easier to visually interpret, meaning it has a wider reach in audience. Overall this may have been a better design choice as the core of the issue; housing crisis for students and minorities, applies not only to Newcastle but the wider UK demographic. 


# 7. Reflection on the hypothetical 'real-life' implication of TenantTalk
<br>
- The entire platform being based off of a non-profit organization advocating for tenants rights means that there is no direct source of income for the org to run the platform on the web, let alone an app. Whilst it is plausible to get funding through campaigns and fundraisers aimed specifically for this goal, in the long-term it is a unsustainable model, unless features such as in-app ads are implemented.

## Data Protection

## Verification Process

<br>

## Terms of Service 
A ToS agreement will be required for Tenant Talk. We did not have the time to write up a formal ToS, however discussed what it would be and look like below.
<br>

<img width="766" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-10 at 15 10 57" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/714578a5-e319-40e0-8b61-ebd14345fcd3">


## Sustainablity of Our Platform
- If Tenant Talk were to be a long-term application for an under-resourced organisation, there would be limits on having real people validate data (time, logistics?)
- Allows close inspection of qualitative entries is a meaninful use of their time rather than engaging in door-to-door talking to students.

<br>

## Acessibillity of Our Platform
Non-discrimination
<br>

# 8. Our Digital Approach
**Figma:**
Figma allowed us to create a prototype for the app with a function similar to that of the final product. Its versatility from being able to present the prototype via link, to allowing live collaboration also made it an excellent choice for refining the work we created over time.
<br><br>
**Adobe Illustrator:**
The programme is an industry standard for creating assets to use in animation and digital designs. Using this programme to create objects such as the house interior and exterior allows us to export the created file, as a vector or svg file. This ensures that the visual end product retains its quality no matter the screen display, and also makes it easier for html development.
<br><br>
**Visual Studio Code:**
The freedom and flexibility of visual studio code allowed us to seamlessly transfer markdown, mermaid, html, css and javascript to our github seamlessly. And it’s plethora of plugins allows us to write certain codes easier.
<br><br>
**Microsoft Forms:**
At the current stage where we do not have a server to collect and store data, microsoft forms was and is the best option for us to collect qualitative data from tenants. Whilst it is limited in its reach due to the manual labor it is still an effective method of collection.

- Allows *Homes to Newcastle* access to an uncharted territory of readily availlable, mass qualitative data stories.
