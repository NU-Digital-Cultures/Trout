# 1. What is Tenant Talk?
<br>

> Tenant Talk is a data advocacy and app campaign platform designed to support Newcastle upon Tyne's student tenant population who can become vulnerable to exploitation and unfair treatment at the hands of their landlords and as a consequence of broader economical processes of gentrification.
<br>

Tenant Talk has been produced to support, and has been thoroughly informed by, *Homes to Newcastle*'s two-fold campaigns. Our app therefore works to:
<br>

1. Expose landlords who neglect their economic and legal responsibilities at their properties, leaving tenants to suffer in unsafe or unpleasant conditions, whilst oftentimes unreasonably increasing the rent price of the property.
2. Reveal how landlords, acting in line with wider gentrification, disproportionately increase the rent of their properties, which tenants who are bound to living in such residential areas face no choice but to agree to price increases at the end of their fixed tenancy period, or live elsewhere.
<br>

Tenant Talk recognises that both of these contentions force tenants **unwillingly** and **unreasonably** into acute, fragile, and subjugated socio-economic positions.
<br>

We decided to narrow the focus of our project to student tenants, although this does not mean to exclude other types of tenants from engaging with and benefitting from our app. This decision was unanimously made given that we are student renters ourselves and our social networks usefully contain fellow student tenants. Hence, collectively as creators, we have first hand experience with and access to further insight regarding the social, economic, and political issues stipulated by the brief. 
<br>

Tenant Talk has been crafted for third typology of student
<br>

Given that the ? terminology of the brief implies a necessity to "expose", we decided that this agenda lended itself usefully to data advocacy approaches (see section 4 for more detail). This wouls invovle

## Tenant Talk fulfils *Homes to Newcastle*'s campaign requirements through it's three major app components:
1. **Tenant Tales** student tenants but also by student tenants.
  <br>
  
2. **Tenant Handbook**
 <br>
 
3. **Tenant Round-Up**

# 2. Critical Reflection on the Context of Our Project
<br>
- survey
- student grassroot campaigns

# 3. Existing Projects

# 4. TenantTalk's Framing Devices
-application of and developed an understanding of critical theories and concepts
<br>

# 5. Project Design Process and Reflections
<br>
Initial ideas we had for our project were rather distant to the final prototype. Our first ideas centred around a complaints management system

# 6. Challenges we Faced and how we attempted to Overcome them
- ethical challenges
- technical challenges
- design challenges
  <br>

# 7. Reflection on the hypothetical 'real-life' implication of TenantTalk
