# 1. What is Tenant Talk?
<br>

<img width="874" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 15 30 36" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/a24f4939-0273-4060-be98-8d3d09206cd8">

> **Tenant Talk** is a data advocacy and app campaign platform designed critically to support Newcastle upon Tyne's student tenant population, who can become vulnerable to exploitative, unethical, and legally problematic practices at the hands of their landlords and as a consequence of broader economical processes of gentrification
<br>


**Tenant Talk** has been produced to support, and has been thoroughly informed by, *Homes to Newcastle*'s two-fold campaigns. *Homes to Newcastle* requested a digital campaign tool that aims to...

The **Tenant Talk** app responds to these two central aims by working to:
<br>

1. Expose landlords who neglect their economic and legal responsibilities at their properties and/ or behave unethically towards their tenants, leaving tenants to suffer in unsafe, unpleasant, or temperamental living conditions. 
2. Reveal how landlords, acting in line with broader economical processes of gentrification, disproportionately increase the rent cost of their properties while students are living in these poor conditions. As gentrification occcurs in predominantly (or nearby) city centre areas, student tenants, who are bound to living in such city-centre residential areas for university, face no choice but to eventually consent to rent price increases at the end of their fixed tenancy period or live elsewhere. However, oftentimes tenants can prematurely or erronously agree to rent price increases because they are not empowered with a full understanding of their rights as tenant to dispute this matter (more detail on this later).
<br>

**Tenant Talk** recognises that both of these contentions force tenants **unwillingly** and **unreasonably** into acute, fragile, and subjugated socio-economic positions. Student tenants are the most severe victims in the renting market, which is contemporarily compounded by the cost of living crisis. Landlords ultimately face no fatal economic struggle as they can increasing the rents of their property(s). This means that landlords occupy hegemonic socio-economic stances over students, who inevitably face paying these higher rents and equally suffer the lived experience of less money being invested into the general maintenance of their rented property (Socialist Worker, 2023). According to Shelter, one in two private renters in England (of some "3.2 million adults") would be unable to pay ther rent in the event of losing their job, and 2.2 million renters would be unable to pay their rent in the same circumstances even with the inclusion of their savings (2023). For students, whom are unable to partake in full time employment due to their university commitments, the economic situation is made ever-more fragile.
<br>

## Student Tenants
We decided to narrow the focus of our project to student tenants, although this does not mean to exclude other types of tenants from engaging with and benefitting from our app. This decision was unanimously made given that we are student renters ourselves and our social networks also usefully contain fellow student tenants. Hence, collectively as creators, we have first hand experience with and access to further insight regarding the social, economic, and political issues stipulated by the brief. 
<br>

Tenant Talk has been crafted for Rugg, Ford and Burrows' third characterised student renting pathway, the "*constrained pathway*" (2006). This incorporates a typology of students who experience relatively severe to severe constraints in the renting/ housing market. These are students who are moving out of their family homes and into (preferred) city centre areas and in the process struggle to source affordable properties to live in due to the increased gentrification of areas. Given that students are unable to commit to full-time employment, and are increasingly facing no choice but to work part-time (Wright, 2024), these students often have "protracted stays" in their parental homes, if possible, or they may have some family support which could be relied upon in terms of economic harship for paying their rent (Rugg, Ford and Burrows, 2006, p.29). However, this typology of students will inevitably lack sufficient enough incomes to afford their rent, placing them as the most- and crucially, involuntarily so- constrained in the housing markets.
<br>

Given the semantic terminology of the brief implies a necessity to "expose" and "reveal", we decided that this agenda lended itself usefully to data advocacy approaches. We therefore, through **Tenant Talk**, aim to make visible both the implications of unethical landlord treatment and economic gentrification on student tenants (see section 4 for more detail), whilst adhering in line with data protection standards (see section 7 for more detail). For our team, such a wide-ranging agenda meant creating a more complex, three-fold approach to our app's components: a **Tenant Tales** interactive map, a **Tenant Handbook**, and a **Tenant Roundup** section. 
<br>

<img width="249" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 16 18 34" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/16b47a48-d81b-4311-8e4b-68cb75232ddd">
<br>

## Our app features explained:
1. The **Tenant Tales** portion of our app consists of an interactive map which is embedded with both qualitative and quantitative data. Our qualitative data exists in the form of tenants' personal stories and experiences of renting. These are uploaded onto the map according to the different areas (specificially, electoral ward boundaries) of Newcastle. Our quantitative data consists of a rent cost analysis organised by the same area criteria as the qualitative data of Newcastle. In essence, the **Tenant Tales** map addresses the empowerment element of the brief: it fosters a shared student identity space where student experiences of renting hold value and can be creatively articulated. Our penultimate idea for this section was that the map would become a supportive hub of qualitative landlord/ area data for student tenants and created by student tenants, which is then interweaved seamlessly with further supportive data indicitative of gentrification levels in specific areas. 
  <br>
  
2. The **Tenant Handbook** presents as an interactive, almost 'cartoon-like' walkthrough of a tenancy. It is focussed upon matters that were evidenced as problematic by student tenants in our Tenant Talk Survey (2024). The **Handbook** visually replicates the inside image of the house that is on our app's opening page. As users navigate the different sections of the house, each item in different rooms correlates to a piece of information that is vital for student tenants to know (and that they had stipulated in our Survey (2024) they would want to know)) about their tenant or landlord's rights and responsibilities within and about the property they are renting. The **Handbook** specifically focusses on the following points of contention for student tenants:
- Disputes processes
- Rent price increasing during a tenancy
- Deposit protection schemes and eventual return
- Property maintenance and repairs
- Tenant safety
- Unjust fees and charges
- No-fault evictions
 <br>

 **The Tenant Handbook** fundamentally empowers tenants with the knowledge, tools, and feeling of social capital (Bourdieu, 1984)/ power to navigate the renting market and their tenancies by being incredibly informative and advisory of the best approaches to navigating difficult renting situations or troublesome landlords. It empowers students to make well-founded demands for a safe, stable, and good quality housing by acting as a vital and easy to comprehend 'what to do' student digital pocket handbook for renting.

The significance of our three app components are discussed thoroughly in section 5.

# 2. Existing Projects
<br>

One of the first steps in our project process was outlining what projects already exist which aim to tackle similar issues as *Homes to Newcastle*. This step was taken in order to see if we could take any inspiration from other projects, to get a sense of what exists and is useful/ not useful, and if it was possible to find a gap in existing project strategies which we could exploit and use in our project. This task was undertaken [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/ExistingProjectEvaluation.docx)

This research led us to the formation of our [Problem Statement](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/tree/tenant-talk/Project%20Direction#:~:text=last%20week-,OurProblemStatement.md,-Update%20OurProblemStatement.md). However, by this point, we had also considered various framing devices that we wanted to adopt (see section 3).
<br>


# 3. Tenant Talk's Framing Devices
<br>

In order to achieve *Homes to Newcastle*'s aims, we decided on two major critical framing devices that would uniquely shape our project. Following research on these devices, they led us to further 
<br>

# Digital Storytelling
- We considered a digital storytelling approach through the lens of academic research, which is presented in our [mindmap](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/tree/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling#:~:text=..-,DigitalStorytellingResearch.md,-Rename%20InitialStorytellingResearch.md).
- - We found that digital storytelling provided a unique way of aligning with Foucault's technologies of the self (Landby, 2008b; Foucault, 1988), which is essential to modern-day identity formation. We undertook further key readings on identity formation [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/tree/tenant-talk/Project%20Research#:~:text=last%20week-,TenantTalkIdentity.md,-Update%20and%20rename). However, in summation,
- We also conducted further research into [non-linear and interactive storytelling](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/tree/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling#:~:text=InteractiveNonLinearStorytelling.md). This consisted of storytelling ideas we could take inspiration from which would develop our own digital storytelling approach. Here we also interrogated the potential ethical, political, and social implications of interactive storytelling.
- Here is our [non-linear storytelling visual](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/tree/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling#:~:text=NonLinearStorytellingVisual.md), the theory underpinning our **Tenant Tales** interactive map.


# Zine Culture

# 4. Critical Reflection on the Context of Our Project
-application of and developed an understanding of critical theories and concepts
<br>

We first undertook research on 

## Our Survey 
(Tenant Talk, 2024)
- survey
- student grassroot campaigns
## The Student Housing Crisis
Student maintenance loans are falling short of their function to support student living, with the loan being "almost entirely wiped out by rent alone" (Weale, 2023).
<br>

# 5. Project Design Process and Reflections
<br>
Initial ideas that we had for our project were rather distant to the final prototype. Our first ideas centred around a complaints management system
- talk about how we felt digital storytelling needed to become more abstract, including audio and visual artworks/ zines
- why the Tenant Handbook is so visual and cartoon-like- because normally heavy information dumps. Also what this digital framework allows us to do given it is digital

# 6. Challenges we Faced and how we attempted to Overcome them
- ethical challenges
- technical challenges
- design challenges
  <br>

# 7. Reflection on the hypothetical 'real-life' implication of TenantTalk
<br>

# 8. Our Digital Approach
Digital- what has tech tools allowed us to do/ has allowed us to respond to the brief in a specific way
