# 1. What is Tenant Talk?
<br>

<img width="874" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 15 30 36" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/a24f4939-0273-4060-be98-8d3d09206cd8">

> **Tenant Talk** is a data advocacy and app campaign platform designed critically to support Newcastle upon Tyne's student tenant population, who can become vulnerable to exploitative, unethical, and legally problematic practices at the hands of their landlords and as a consequence of broader economical processes of gentrification
<br>


**Tenant Talk** has been produced to support, and has been thoroughly informed by, *Homes to Newcastle*'s two-fold campaigns. *Homes to Newcastle* requested a digital campaign tool that aims to...

<img width="985" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 15 29 43" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/a4cb3b08-59ce-4096-9ae1-5725cea71617">

The **Tenant Talk** app responds to these two central aims by working to:
<br>

1. Expose landlords who neglect their economic and legal responsibilities at their properties and/ or behave unethically towards their tenants, leaving tenants to suffer in unsafe, unpleasant, or temperamental living conditions. 
2. Reveal how landlords, acting in line with broader economical processes of gentrification, disproportionately increase the rent cost of their properties while students are living in these poor conditions. As gentrification occcurs in predominantly (or nearby) city centre areas, student tenants, who are bound to living in such city-centre residential areas for university, face no choice but to eventually consent to rent price increases at the end of their fixed tenancy period or live elsewhere. However, oftentimes tenants can prematurely or erronously agree to rent price increases because they are not empowered with a full understanding of their rights as tenant to dispute this matter (more detail on this later).
<br>

**Tenant Talk** recognises that both of these contentions force tenants **unwillingly** and **unreasonably** into acute, fragile, and subjugated socio-economic positions. Student tenants are the most severe victims in the renting market, which is contemporarily compounded by the cost of living crisis. Landlords ultimately face no fatal economic struggle as they can increasing the rents of their property(s). This means that landlords occupy hegemonic socio-economic stances over students, who inevitably face paying these higher rents and equally suffer the lived experience of less money being invested into the general maintenance of their rented property (Socialist Worker, 2023). According to Shelter, one in two private renters in England (of some "3.2 million adults") would be unable to pay ther rent in the event of losing their job, and 2.2 million renters would be unable to pay their rent in the same circumstances even with the inclusion of their savings (2023). For students, whom are unable to partake in full time employment due to their university commitments, the economic situation is made ever-more fragile.
<br>

## Student Tenants
We decided to narrow the focus of our project to student tenants, although this does not mean to exclude other types of tenants from engaging with and benefitting from our app. This decision was unanimously made given that we are student renters ourselves and our social networks also usefully contain fellow student tenants. Hence, collectively as creators, we have first hand experience with and access to further insight regarding the social, economic, and political issues stipulated by the brief. 
<br>

Tenant Talk has been crafted for Rugg, Ford and Burrows' third characterised student renting pathway, the "*constrained pathway*" (2006). This incorporates a typology of students who experience relatively severe to severe constraints in the renting/ housing market. These are students who are moving out of their family homes and into (preferred) city centre areas and in the process struggle to source affordable properties to live in due to the increased gentrification of areas. Given that students are unable to commit to full-time employment, and are increasingly facing no choice but to work part-time (Wright, 2024), these students often have "protracted stays" in their parental homes, if possible, or they may have some family support which could be relied upon in terms of economic harship for paying their rent (Rugg, Ford and Burrows, 2006, p.29). However, this typology of students will inevitably lack sufficient enough incomes to afford their rent, placing them as the most- and crucially, involuntarily so- constrained in the housing markets.
<br>

Given the semantic terminology of the brief implies a necessity to "expose" and "reveal", we decided that this agenda lended itself usefully to data advocacy approaches. We therefore, through **Tenant Talk**, aim to make visible both the implications of unethical landlord treatment and economic gentrification on student tenants (see section 4 for more detail), whilst adhering in line with data protection standards (see section 7 for more detail). For our team, such a wide-ranging agenda meant creating a more complex, three-fold approach to our app's components: a **Tenant Tales** interactive map, a **Tenant Handbook**, and a **Tenant Roundup** section. 
<br>

## This is the opening page of our app:

<img width="249" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 16 18 34" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/16b47a48-d81b-4311-8e4b-68cb75232ddd">
<br>

## Our app features explained:
1. The **Tenant Tales** portion of our app consists of an interactive map which is embedded with both qualitative and quantitative data. Our qualitative data exists in the form of tenants' personal stories and experiences of renting. These are uploaded onto the map according to the different areas (specificially, electoral ward boundaries) of Newcastle. Our quantitative data consists of a rent cost analysis organised by the same area criteria as the qualitative data of Newcastle. In essence, the **Tenant Tales** map addresses the empowerment element of the brief: it fosters a shared student identity space where student experiences of renting hold value and can be creatively articulated. Our penultimate idea for this section was that the map would become a supportive hub of qualitative landlord/ area data for student tenants and created by student tenants, which is then interweaved seamlessly with further supportive data indicitative of gentrification levels in specific areas. 
  <br>
  
2. The **Tenant Handbook** presents as an interactive, almost 'cartoon-like' walkthrough of a tenancy. It is focussed upon matters that were evidenced as problematic by student tenants in our Tenant Talk Survey (2024). The **Handbook** visually replicates the inside image of the house that is on our app's opening page. As users navigate the different sections of the house, each item in different rooms correlates to a piece of information that is vital for student tenants to know (and that they had stipulated in our Survey (2024) they would want to know)) about their tenant or landlord's rights and responsibilities within and about the property they are renting. The **Handbook** specifically focusses on the following points of contention for student tenants:
- Disputes processes
- Rent price increasing during a tenancy
- Deposit protection schemes and eventual return
- Property maintenance and repairs
- Tenant safety
- Unjust fees and charges
- No-fault evictions
 <br>

 The **Tenant Handbook** fundamentally empowers tenants with the knowledge, tools, and feeling of social capital (Bourdieu, 1984)/ power to navigate the renting market and their tenancies by being incredibly informative and advisory of the best approaches to navigating difficult renting situations or troublesome landlords. It empowers students to make well-founded demands for a safe, stable, and good quality housing by acting as a vital and easy to comprehend 'what to do' student digital pocket handbook for renting.
<br>
 
3. Our **Tenant Round-Up** (TROY FILL THIS IN)
   <br>

<img width="726" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 16 19 06" src="https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/assets/160641654/7c0165d8-a354-4467-8089-74a89da815d3">

<br>

The significance of our three app components are discussed thoroughly in section 5. 
<br>

# 2. Existing Projects
<br>

One of the first steps in our project process was outlining what projects already exist which aim to tackle similar issues as *Homes to Newcastle*. This step was taken in order to see if we could take any inspiration from other projects, to get a sense of what exists and is useful/ not useful, and if it was possible to find a gap in existing project strategies which we could exploit and use in our project. This task was undertaken [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/ExistingProjectEvaluation.docx).

This research led us to the formation of our [problem statement](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Direction/OurProblemStatement.md). However, by this point, we had also considered various framing devices that we wanted to adopt (see section 3).
<br>

# 3. Critical Reflection on the Context of Our Project
Tenant Talk is situated within contextual critical theories and concepts to do with student renting.
<br>

We undertook research on student renting, landlords in Newcastle, Gentrification in Newcastle, and scholarship that theorised gentrification so that we could best get to grips with our project's context. 

<br>


-application of and developed an understanding of critical theories and concepts
<br>

We first undertook research on 




## Student Renting and the Student Housing Crisis
- student grassroot campaigns
<br>

Student maintenance loans are falling short of their function to support student living, with the loan being "almost entirely wiped out by rent alone" (Weale, 2023).
<br>

## Gentrification
Below are some data visualisations we created in order to understand gentrification in the North East region specificaly
### This data visualisation showcases a complex view of rental price increases over time, in relation to monthly and annual price change rates
 - https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17544774/embed
 - General upward trend with regular peaks and troughs. However, there was more of a rapid rent increase trend from April 2022, reaching a peak in January 2023 (which is the most currrently available data)
 - This showcases the severity of rent increases in the North East for tenants
 - Again, highest annual change rate in rent increase in 2023 
<br>

### This data visualisation highlights differences in increased rental costs based on renting property type
- https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17545301/embed
- Relatively similar increases in one/ two/ three bed properties
- Steeper increase in four (or more) properties- **students are more likely to house share** and therefore rent these properties
 <br>

> All of this data is sourced from ONS: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/priceindexofprivaterentsukmonthlypricestatistics 
<br>

> The csv files were filtered to show specific data types and data for the **North East** region only.
<br>

### What is Gentrification?
To grasp the mechanisms behind gentrification, we looked at [scholarly theorisations of gentrifcation](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Gentrification/GentrificationTheories.md). We found the Rental Gap Theory (RGT) the most persuasive for how understanding how it impacts tenants' rents. We applied this concept into our app by thinking of how we could best represent this gentrification process and the consequences it has for tenants in the form of data. This was done in our [GentrificationAsData](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Direction/GentrificationAsData.md) file. 
## Our Survey 
(Tenant Talk, 2024)
<br>

# 4. Tenant Talk's Framing Devices
In order to achieve *Homes to Newcastle*'s aims, we decided on two major critical framing devices that would uniquely shape our project, which are briefly summarised below. These devices would eventually steer the creative direction of our **Tenant Tales** interactive map.
<br>

## 1. Digital Storytelling 
- We considered a digital storytelling approach through the lens of academic research, which is presented in our [mermaid map](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling/DigitalStorytellingResearch.md).
- We found that digital storytelling provided a unique way of aligning with Foucault's 'technologies of the self' (Landby, 2008b), that is, the materialist view that through users' interaction with and consequent self-regulation through digital technologies, modern subjects and groups can become to define themselves and their identities through such technologies (Foucault, 1988). Therefore, through digital storytelling, we can facilitate on our platform a space whereby tenant subjects can somewhat free themselves from their current renting situations or constraints by redefining and subverting their reality on their own terms on our app. Our initial take and readings on identity, community, and vernacular formation is [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/TenantTalkIdentity.md). Our aim was to create a collective tenant identity on our platform which intersects in tandem with our contemporary media-saturated society.
<br>

## 1. (Non-Linear & Interactive) Digital Storytelling 
- We also conducted further research into [non-linear and interactive storytelling](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling/InteractiveNonLinearStorytelling.md). This consisted of researching storytelling approaches that we could take inspiration from, from which would develop our own digital storytelling approach. Here we also interrogated the potential ethical, political, and social implications of interactive storytelling.
- Here is our [non-linear storytelling visual](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Research/Digital%20Storytelling/NonLinearStorytellingVisual.md), the non-linear torytelling theory that we used to underpin our **Tenant Tales** interactive map.
<br>

## 2. Zine Culture
- 

<br>

ðŸŸ°

## Pulling these framing devices together and as relational to student renting/ housing conversations :warning:
- We also applied Foucault's 'technologies of the self' more broadly 
- How where a student lives shapes their life/ identity and our tool gives students a way to change the power dynamics at play there
- And how the information asymmetry of landlords-tenants is not just about finding the best price for accomodation, but a deeper set of relationships that the combination of our three approaches can change
- What is special about the case of student tenants- landlord structures and how our tool works in that context
<br>

# 5. Project Design Process and Reflections
<br>
Initial ideas that we had for our project were rather distant to the final prototype. Our first ideas centred around a creating a sort of informal 'complaints management' system. Our ideas are discussed throughout our group [meeting log](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/MeetingLog.md).
<br>

All of our key project decisions that we made in relation to these meetings are documented [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/KeyProjectDecisions.md).
<br>

Over time, we updated this [flow diagram](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Direction/ScopeOfProject.md) to capture the full scope of our project. 
<br>

Alongside discussions with eachother and the creation of offline and online ['to-do' lists](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/Updated%20to%20do%20list.md), we more formally documented our individual taks using a Gantt chart as a [project timeline](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/ProjectTimeline.md). 
<br> 

Our individual reflections on/ about our project are [here](https://github.com/NU-Digital-Cultures/Trout/blob/tenant-talk/Project%20Management/IndividualReflections.md). 
- talk about how we felt digital storytelling needed to become more abstract, including audio and visual artworks/ zines
- why the Tenant Handbook is so visual and cartoon-like- because normally heavy information dumps. Also what this digital framework allows us to do given it is digital
<br>

SOI: Why the map is organised via electoral ward boundaries? How does this meaningfully organise space according to our projects objectives?

# 6. Challenges we Faced and how we attempted to Overcome them
## Ethical challenges
We faced difficulties in terms of balancing privacy concerns with the import of having tenant submissions spatially located. We felt that the anonymity of the submissions, although sorted according to area, could constrain the overall utility of our map. However, we realised there would ultimately still be advantages to this approach as it nevertheless permits *Homes to Newcastle* access to nuanced, in-depth, and broad qualitative data that they would not otherwise would not have.
<br>

Moreover, having publicly available data for regions
<br>

## Technical challenges
We found that geospatial data can be rather limited in terms of accuracy of area boundaries, however we felt this was not a point of contention given the similarly broad and loose nature of our app submissions process; submissions just needed to be roughly organised per area for the purposes of clear visual understanding.
<br>

## Design challenges
<br>

# 7. Reflection on the hypothetical 'real-life' implication of TenantTalk
<br>

## Data Protection

<br>

## Sustainablity of Our Platform
- If Tenant Talk were to be a long-term application for an under-resourced organisation, there would be limits on having real people validate data (time, logistics?)
- Allows close inspection of qualitative entries is a meaninful use of their time rather than engaging in door-to-door talking to students.
