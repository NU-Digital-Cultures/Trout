 ## Rugg, J., Ford, J. and Burrows, R. (2006) 'Housing advantage? The role of student renting in the consitution of housing biographies in the United Kingdom', *Journal of Youth Studies*, 7(1), pp. 19-34. Available at: https://doi-org.libproxy.ncl.ac.uk/10.1080/1367626042000209930
- Centres upon the idea of a new student leaving their home environment and moving out
- Constucts typologies of different student renting pathways
- Useful due to its focus on the operation of economic and housing market constraints

  Directly quoting phrases from the article here...
  - 1st pathway= "*chaotic* pathway": limitied planning; absense of family support perhaps due to domestic disputes with parents; left home at early age; limited financial resources so cannot access accomodation in PRS; moves between staying with family members, serial hostel stays, may sleep on street; spatial reach of pathway restricted to particular town/ city
  - 2nd= '*unplanned* pathwaay': no planning; some family support as move supported by family; move is unexpected; limited financial support; may access PRS
  - 3rd= '*constraned* pathway': clear planning; family support; move closer to work; move into PRS; **constraints experienced in labour and housing market**; potential protracted stay in the parental home because of the **lack of available and affordable properties** on the owner-occpied market/ PRS; inability to secure reasonably paid, **no long-term employment** means unable to get mortgage; *steep property price increase are an obstacle for these first-time buyers/ renters*; *geographically bound to a location due to work commitments*
  - ↘️ **This 3rd path is applicable to our project**
  - 4th= '*planned non-student* pathway': substantial planning; few/ managable constraints; delayed leaving of parental home due to limited economic resources/ family formation; could by property with a partner on city outskirts; geographic boundaries limitied
