 # Data handling and protection considerations we would have to account for if our project was implicated in 'real-life'

 ## UK Government (2024) *Data protection: The Data Protection Act*. Available at: https://www.gov.uk/data-protection#:~:text=The%20Data%20Protection%20Act%202018,Data%20Protection%20Regulation%20(GDPR) (Accessed: 14 April 2024).
- This is the 'Data Protection Act' of 2018 (UK implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- (The act itself is analysed at the bottom of this file) :arrow_heading_down:
- The act "controls how your personal infromation ise used by organisations, businesses or the government" para.1
- As we are using users' personal data in our project, we must follow the data protection principles, which ensure information used is: "used fairly, lawfully and transparently; used for specified, explicit purposes; used in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to only what is necessary; accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; kept for no longer than is necessary; handled in a way that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unlawful or unauthorised processing, access, loss, destruction or damage - para.3
- There is stronger legal protection for data which includes sensitive information. In our case, this could include users' political opinions if they are projected in submissions, given that gentrification, housing, and renting are predominantly governmental issues
- Users have the right to be informed about how your data is being used; access personal data; have incorrect data updated; have data erased
stop or restrict the processing of your data; data portability (allowing you to get and reuse your data for different services); object to how your data is processed in certain circumstances - para.9
- As **HtN is a community interest company**, we would not need to consider additional personal data rights given there is **no intention to profit from user data/ no intention of inputting user data into making predictive algorithms**
- We would however need a consent form and ToS pages at the opening of our app which would stipulate the handling of user data in relation to this act. See GDPR (below) for consent details we could include...

  ## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (2016) *Official Journal of the European Union* L 119, 27 April, pp. 1-88. Available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679 (Accessed: 14 April 2024).
- This is the General Data Protection Regulation enforced by EU Parliament and Council
<br>

  Key considerations:
  - 4: "The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind [...] data [...] must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against other funamental rights" (ie. human rights) p.2
  - **We have abided by this by our project objective (digital storytelling as a socio-economic intervention tool/ instrument promoting advocacy for the benefit of humans)**
  - 6: "high level of the protection of personal data"
  - **So submissions would be anonymised with pseudonyms and data input on our app held with highest confidentiality (ie. submissions to the app would have to be read and checked by us but not discussed further (we sign confidentiality agreement?) and data stored exclusively and securely on our system)**
  - 13: "Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed." p.8
  - **We will not be doing much processing of data, and certainly not for economic means, but in the consent form we would state transparently how user data will be collected, stored, and how it will be used on and by our app**
  <br>
  
 Key definitions which are useful:
- **Personal data**: "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person." p.33
- **Our personal data reveals individuals by name (even if psuedonymisation, as this is still an "online identifier" (as stated further in **26** p.5)) and the "mental", "economic", "cultural", and "social identity" is exposed via tenant submissions**
- **If we use location data to place where tenant submissions are on from onto our map then we would need to ensure this is protected information by setting it apart from tenants' profile somehow. Or, to avoid this completely, we could allow tenants to self-dictate the area they have rented in (given that they also may not be physically in that area when they submit)**
- **Consent**: "any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her" p.34
- **So consent could look like a clearly, open written declaration on our part, with a consent option below**

## Tommasi, S. (2023) *The Risk of Discrimination in the Digital Market: From the Digital Services Act to the Future. 1st edn*. Cham: Springer. Available at: https://link-springer-com.libproxy.ncl.ac.uk/book/10.1007/978-3-031-43640-6
- The opening chapter analyses EU Regulation 2022/2065, the 'Digital Services Act' and how it can be implicated to avoid discrimination within providing a digital service
-  Non-discrimination in digital service is essential: "facilitating fair and non-discriminatory conditions for users during the digital transformation"
- European Declaration on Digital Rights and the Principles for the Digital Decade "calls for a model of digital transformation that strengthens the human dimension of the ecosystem" p.6
- Stipulates the "online dimension of our lives cannot ignore being supportive and inclusive"
- Our technological solution therefore must "enable the exercise of rights, promote inclusion and pursue a digital transformation that leaves no one behind" p.7
- **This could look like ensuring accessibility on the app (different language, disability feautrues etc) and creating a digital transformative environment that allows all submissions to be considered equally and in their full context**

The UK Data Protection Act is here:
## *Data Protection Act (2018)*, c. 12. Available at: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted (Accessed: 14 April 2024).
- Protection of personal data agenda is clear, and is similarly applied as it is in GDPR. It stipulates the requirement that "personal data [is] to be  processed lawfully and fairly, on the basis of the data subject's consent or another specified basis"
- ALso includes the idea that "inaccurate personal data [...] [must be] rectified" (all taken from **section.2 of part 1**)
  <br>
  
  Similar key terms:
  - "**Identifiable living individual**": "an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data or an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of the individual" (taken from **section.3 of part 1**)
  - **So a lot of the GDPR is applied to the Data Protection Act** :warning:
  <br>

  Information relevant to our project on lawfulness of processing: public interest etc (**part 8**)
  - "processing of personal data that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of the controller' official authority includes the processing of personal data that is necesssary for": "the administration of justice"; "the exercise of a function conferred on a person by enactment or rule of law"; "an activity that supports or promotes democratic engagement"
  - Again, similar to GDPR :warning:
