# Some example 'Tenant Tales'

### First Tale
<br>
Zachary is a second year student in Newcastle University. According to the landlord, they said they had ticked all the facilities as undamaged on the checklist and that the landlord had agreed to be able to move the placement of the beds, desks, etc. in the room but when Zachary got to the room he found a large burn mark on the floor of the bedside table after he had moved it. When Zachary spoke to the landlord, the landlord said that they could not repair the damage during the term of the contract, which meant that Zachary would have to stay in the room with the hole in the floor for a whole year. The landlord's behaviour upset Zachary, who felt he had a right to live in a repaired room. However, he is an international student and doesn't know the laws here, and he doesn't dare, there is no way to appeal against this property agent.

### Second Tale
<br>
Johnason was a freshman last year. He was told by the real estate agent during last year's room tour that the washing machine in his dormitory was capable of doing laundry and drying clothes in one. However, after his sophomore year, he found out that the washer was not able to dry clothes. He was very upset about this and thought he would need to buy extra drying racks, etc. and that his clothes didn't dry quickly. He thinks that the real estate agent cheated him last year, and likewise, he is an international student and doesn't know what he should do to get the real estate to make amends.
