- The survey was intended to act as a baseline outlining specific, personally experienced renting issues by tenants in the context of the Newcastle's landlords and renting market
- The survey was posted across all our social media stories, adopting a nonprobabilistic participant sampling approach
- Potential participants were made aware what their data would be used for and why, and there was a consent process before completion of the survey

## The production of the survey was informed by the following 'good practice' readings:
### Brown, M. (2023) *Writing Good Survey Questions: 10 Best Practices*. Available at: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/survey-best-practices/ (Accessed: 8 April 2024).
- Standard rule of thumb is to ask questions that are intentional  (not just there for the sake of it and have a desired outcome) and suit the survey format. This will ensure reliable and accurate data is received
- Questions need to be worded to minimize bias. This can be achieved by using neutral language/ balanced answering scales 
- Surveys are quantitative at heart due to multiple choice/ rating-scale questions, but the best surveys rely upon closed-ended questions and are additionally supplemented by open-ended questions to provide additional "qualitative color" which supports quantitative data
- For open-ended questions, include at least one broad open-ended question at the end of the survey as participants may have a lot to say but are just waiting for the right question to come up which would allow them to do so. A final, optional, long-answer question with a prompt: "Is there anything else you'd like to share? would supply potentially valuable data
- Avoid double-barreled questions- ask them separately

### Kohler, T. (2023) *10 Survey Challenges and How to Avoid them*. Available at: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/10-survey-challenges/ (Accessed: 8 April 2024).
  - There is a necessity to avoid response bias
  - A limitation of our survey is that participants can filter responses- they only share what they want to share so need to acknowledge that we may not be getting the full picture
  - Another limitation is that we cannot probe, but this can be somewhat overcome by asking close-ended questions followed up by open-ended questions that allow participants to expand on their response
  - Similarly, it is impossible to know why they selected a multiple choice option- counter this by having a further optional box to say more
  - Recall bias prevents participants remembering in full the events they have experienced. Again, the only way to overcome this is asking for more detail and then us acknowledging that even then, responses may be limited
  - **However, in terms of the aim of our project which is to capture tenants' stories from the perspective of their personal experiences, this isn't as much of an issue as we are wanting to create a tenant identity through their stories, which, like any identity/ story, will be usefully informed by perspective/ slanted angles** ⚠️

## Survery results
- The results of this Survey are intended to inform the production of our 'Tenant Tales' page, ie. whichever questions produce the most response/ the most detail from a participant and are conveyed by the participant as being a problem will be privileged on our app interface
