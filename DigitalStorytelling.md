  root((Digital Storytelling via our app- using tenants' stories as means of achieving insight into the issues of gentrification and unethical landlord practices))
    What is digital storytelling?
     Has been defined as a way to slow down complex cultural movements, making an "artifact" out of a transformative narrative. Lambert, 2009, p.xv
    Why are we adopting a digital storytelling approach?
      It is a relatively new practice, deeming it a rather innovative and relevant approach for the contemporary client
    Ethical issues
      Potential harm can come from the digital storytelling process as users are disclosing sensitive/ triggering/ personal information
        To contend with this issue, 
      Tenants sharing personal information related themselves and their landlords
        To overcome this, we should have a page making users aware of the way their submissions will be stored, used, and represented on the app
        We would also require a page with a consent form
        Need to anonymise submissions on the app/ give pseudonym names
    Probelms and potential pitfalls of digital storytelling
      It requires the participants and sponsoring organisations to "make complicated ethical judgements and recruiting storytellers", "the role of storytellers in the process", and how those stories are represented on their own and/ or in relation to others. Dush, 2012, p.627
        To overcome this, we would need to think critically about how we select tenants as storytellers and how we intend to represent their stories
          We also need to consider how we represent data on the interactive map- how will we meaningfully organise geographical space to best convey our agenda?
