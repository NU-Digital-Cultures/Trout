  root((Digital Storytelling: using tenants' stories as means of achieving insight into the issues of gentrification and unethical landlord practices))
    What is digital storytelling?
     Has been defined as a way to slow down complex cultural movements, making an "artifact" out of a transformative narrative. Lambert, 2009, p.xv
     Digital storytelling is a "collectively embedded practice." Dush, 2012, p.629. This means that by nature of including different participants with different intersectional backgrounds/ socio-economic contexts, the practice of digital storytelling could take on different forms and produce different consequences- whether positive or harmful. Thus, we should take into consideration and be prepared to account for the fact that not all stories shared will solely positively contribute to the project
    Why are we adopting a digital storytelling approach?
      It is a relatively new practice- the traditional form of telling stories has now transgressed into a more public digital dimension, using "digital media resources", deeming it a rather innovative and relevant approach for the contemporary client. Landby, 2008b, p.366
      Harks back to Foucault's 'technologies of the self', opening "doors for the individual's self to emerge in public." Landby, 2008b, p.367
         Provides now opportunities for "individual identity gormation in media-saturated societies." Lundby, 2008a, p.363
      As Burgess points, storytelling can function as an effective creative outlet for ordinary voices: "technologies discourse from the 'grassroots' converges persistently with emerging neoliberal business and economic models under which consumers" or users, "particularly of technology, are considered to possess and exercise more creativity and agency than before, combined with a surge in both the participation in and power of voluntary work and 'productive' leisure." 2006, p.202
     Due to the contemporary economy
        "the figure of the 'creative consumer' is seen as both a key to the new economy and a major potential disruption to the dominance of commercial media. Lessig, 2004, quoted in Burgess, 2006, p.201.
         Could establish a 'tenant vernacular' sort of speak
      Permits personal agency and self- development of the storyteller. Lundby, 2008a. The idea of 'getting it out' materially can be freeing and liberating for an individual
      Digital storytelling can offer new avenues for communication and participation in online communities: "Digital stories made by amateurs may encourage social participation in those contexts where the stories are produced and used." Lundby, 2008b, p.363.
     Opens up space for democracy
       "New forms of social participation that are encouraged by digital storytelling relate to creating stories as well as sharing them in larger publics" and in cases of self-representational digital stories, "the public or 'readers' may be very close to the producers and switch roles." Lundby, 2008b, p.368
        Digital storytelling "not only bypasses set forms of authority, but also invites new forms" as the relationship between "authorship and the authority of author and text is at stake."
          Thus, digital storytelling challenges established patterns of authority "based on various forms of institution ligitimacy" and storytellings have the "means to develop new forms of authority" rooted in the "legitimacy of symbolic power."                    Utilising tenants as storytelleres thereby subverts the established institutional hegemonic power dynamic of landlord over the tenant by permitting the tenant access to democratizing, agency-inducing symbolic power
    Ethical issues
      Potential harm can come from the digital storytelling process as users are disclosing sensitive/ personal information. In terms of the power relationship with the app, tenants are what Dush calls "vulnerable" subjects. 2012, p.633
        To contend with this issue, informed consent of the user must be obtained, whereby the user is aware in full about the aims and scope of our project. Users will also face no obligatory pressure to take part in the app/ submit their stories in order to have access to the app
      Is there an ethical responsiblity for us to provide emotional/ psychological support?
      Do tenants, as storytellers, need full control of the writing/ editing process? Need to consider the "danger of appropriating someone else's story if they are not given control at all moments." Dush, 2012, p.631
         Users should be given various controls/ options to creating their story on their own terms- what will this look like? Ie. options for photos/ videos/ artwork/ poems/ written extracts etc
            The power of digital storytelling accumulates with multimodality"; it affords "not just a new way to make meaning, but a different kind of meaning." Hull and Nelson, 2005, p.225
               For example, pictures "do not convey meaning in the same way that language does" and hence, "their meaning-making affordances are different." Hull and Nelson, 2005, p.229. So, should we pay attention to different semiotic codes that could be produced by our app?
      Tenants will be sharing personal information related themselves and their landlords. Equally, when stories are uploaded onto our app, they could be used for "unknown purposes." Dush, 2012, p.633
        To overcome this moral/ ethical anxiety we should have a page containing a consent form which will clearly make users aware of the specific way in which their submissions will be stored, used, and represented on the app. Stipulating terms of participation- kind of like an app's ToS- are essential to handling storytelling practices ethically. Pryluck, 2005; Winston, 2005
        We would also require a page with a consent form
        Need to anonymise submissions on the app/ give pseudonym names
    Probelms and potential pitfalls of digital storytelling
      It requires the participants and sponsoring organisations to "make complicated ethical judgements and recruiting storytellers", "the role of storytellers in the process", and how those stories are represented on their own and/ or in relation to others. Dush, 2012, p.627
        To overcome this, we would need to think critically about how we select tenants as storytellers and how we intend to represent their stories
          We also need to consider how we represent data on the interactive map- how will we meaningfully organise geographical space to best convey our agenda?
