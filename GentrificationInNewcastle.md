- From the perspective of artists and their experiences of 'gentrifying bohemia' in the Ouseburn Valley, Newcastle upon Tyne
- This article does not focus closely upon renting however provides insights into gentrification processes in Ouseburn
 <br>

- They insist that "gentrification in this area cannot solely be understood as a process of displacement, but is also clearly linked to the growth modes of regulation and commercialisaton in social space." p. 318. So the idea of increasing regulation brought about by the local state has impacted the area socially and culturally- this might be something we want to capture in tenants' qualitative submissions
- "property development [...] [that is] commercially-orientated" p.318
- "Recent ward changes have seen the Ouseburn Valley [...] become separated by an administrative boundary from Byker, to which it was traditionally (in both bureaucratic/ administrative and social space) attached and incorporated into a new ward called 'Ouseburn'" and such changes have "placed the Valley more solidly within a middle-class constituency" p.318

- This is a much older article, however explores similar issues to our project, specifically the tension/ conflict between the incoming of more affluent individuals and existing local residents
- Similar to TenantTalk, it highlights "the imperative to consult and empower local residents" in the face of gentrification processes
- This article will allow us to understand how gentrificaton has operated in Newcastle historically
<br>

*Going for Growth*
- Newcastle City Council launched a city-wide large-scale regeneration strategy called *Going for Growth* in July 1999, headed 'Plan to rebuild Newcastle is biggest since war'
- No large scale redevelopment plan like this since the 1970s
- What was different about this strategy was how it was advertised as "deliberate, socially engineered gentrification." Idea of "positive gentrification" was born, defined as a necessity to "'rebalance' the population of disadvantaged and stigmatised neighbourhoods" p.2367
- The strategy linked population loss and low housing demand to: economic development, retention/ growth of population, deprived/ stigmatised areas p.2369
- This gentrification-promoting policy was driven by fear about the economic future of the city/ people living outside city boundaries p.2369
- So, aimed to tackle growing economic/ social division in city. Idea of balancing out economic/ social levels throughout the city with regeneration initiatives
- Core strategy= large-scale housing redevelopment: "6600 dwellings demolished - 5000 in West End and 1600 in the East End" which were mostly in areas of council housing. In their place, "new housing would be constructed by private developers and Registered Social Landlords." p.2369
- All backed by the idea of introducing a new, more middle-class population to these areas
> blockquote introduce a new population which will be integrated with existing communities [and] create the size and diversity of population to support the development of new schools and other essential community infrastructures - NCC, 2000a, p.16

  Newcastle's wider context/ population type at the time
- Small city, about a quarter of a million people p.2368
- Newcastle has "long been a paradigm of deindustrialisation and economic and population decline"
- It is a post-industrial city
- Newcastle's economy has seen "a shift from manufacturing service employment" which has generated a "substantial 'service-class' element in the population"
- Levels of unemployment very high by national standards and in terms of jobs: "poor quality, insecure and low paid employment"
- There was a "collapse of traditional well-paid skilled manual work"
- Also low housing demand in neighbourhood areas due to regional economic weakness which led to population loss through migration. Causes 'loose' housing and land markets and creates surplus of housing stock- so no conflict over housing which is what characterises gentrification
- Social problems of crime and anti-social behaviour further high levels of vacancy
- People migrate to areas regarded as safer and higher-status
- So, what all of this shows is that Newcastle has historically been a city of economic polarisation and thus a well-set hotbed for gentrification to occur p.2368
