- From the perspective of artists and their experiences of 'gentrifying bohemia' in the Ouseburn Valley, Newcastle upon Tyne
- This article does not focus closely upon renting however provides insights into gentrification processes in Ouseburn
 <br>

- They insist that "gentrification in this area cannot solely be understood as a process of displacement, but is also clearly linked to the growth modes of regulation and commercialisaton in social space." p. 318. So the idea of increasing regulation brought about by the local state has impacted the area socially and culturally- this might be something we want to capture in tenants' qualitative submissions
- "property development [...] [that is] commercially-orientated" p.318
- "Recent ward changes have seen the Ouseburn Valley [...] become separated by an administrative boundary from Byker, to which it was traditionally (in both bureaucratic/ administrative and social space) attached and incorporated into a new ward called 'Ouseburn'" and such changes have "placed the Valley more solidly within a middle-class constituency" p.318

- This is a much older article, however explores similar issues to our project, specifically the tension/ conflict between the incoming of more affluent individuals and existing local residents
- Similar to TenantTalk, it highlights "the imperative to consult and empower local residents" in the face of gentrification processes
- This article will allow us to understand how gentrificaton has operated in Newcastle historically
- Also allows us to develop a working definition of gentrification
<br>

*Going for Growth*
- Newcastle City Council launched a city-wide large-scale regeneration strategy called *Going for Growth* in July 1999, headed 'Plan to rebuild Newcastle is biggest since war'
- No large scale redevelopment plan like this since the 1970s
- What was different about this strategy was how it was advertised as "deliberate, socially engineered gentrification." Idea of "positive gentrification" was born, defined as a necessity to "'rebalance' the population of disadvantaged and stigmatised neighbourhoods" p.2367
- The strategy linked population loss and low housing demand to: economic development, retention/ growth of population, deprived/ stigmatised areas p.2369
- This gentrification-promoting policy was driven by fear about the economic future of the city/ people living outside city boundaries p.2369
- So, aimed to tackle growing economic/ social division in city. Idea of balancing out economic/ social levels throughout the city with regeneration initiatives
- Core strategy= large-scale housing redevelopment: "6600 dwellings demolished - 5000 in West End and 1600 in the East End" which were mostly in areas of council housing. In their place, "new housing would be constructed by private developers and Registered Social Landlords." p.2369
- All backed by the idea of introducing a new, more middle-class population to these areas:
> "introduce a new population which will be integrated with existing communities [and] create the size and diversity of population to support the development of new schools and other essential community infrastructures." (NCC, 2000, p.16)
> - NCC (Newcastle City Council) (2000) Going for Growth: A Green Paper Newcastle: NCC.
- Used the failings of past policies to adopt a more holistic, radical, and heavy-handed approach. Stated they didn't work as Newcastle was still suffering from poverty and decline p.2370
- There were local protests and oppositon from Liberal Democrats who "produced alternative proposals for a more community-based approach" p.2371
- *Going for Growth* was gentrification as it "combined two essential elements of *displacement* of the existting lower income population and their *replacement* with more affluent households" with the "clear intention [...] that the population which replaces them wll be drawn from a different social stratum- owner-occupiers rather than social tenants, working rather than unemployed or economically inactive and with comparatively higher incomes and social status" **We could use this as a possible definition for gentrification**. Idea of the disadvantaging of the population displaced p.2372
- To assess whether there is disadvantage, look at relocation policies adopted by the City Council. In this case, there was sufficient alternative council housing offered and displaced tenants were given priority for rehousing. p.2372
- But what if not possible or desirable:
> "Some will be rehoused in the are or within the city and some wll choose to leave the area [...] there is not a blanket promise that everyone who wants to move back will." (*Newcastle Evening Chronicle*, 2000) (Kevin Jones quote)
> - *Newcastle Evening Chronicle* (2000) 'City fears answered'
 <br>
<br>

  Newcastle's wider context/ population type at the time and why gentrification occured (theoretical):
- Small city, about a quarter of a million people p.2368
- Newcastle has "long been a paradigm of deindustrialisation and economic and population decline"
- It is a post-industrial city
- Newcastle's economy has seen "a shift from manufacturing service employment" which has generated a "substantial 'service-class' element in the population"
- Levels of unemployment very high by national standards and in terms of jobs: "poor quality, insecure and low paid employment"
- There was a "collapse of traditional well-paid skilled manual work"
- Also low housing demand in neighbourhood areas due to regional economic weakness which led to population loss through migration. Causes 'loose' housing and land markets and creates surplus of housing stock- so no conflict over housing which is what characterises gentrification
- Social problems of crime and anti-social behaviour further high levels of vacancy
- People migrate to areas regarded as safer and higher-status
- So, what all of this shows is that Newcastle has historically been a city of economic polarisation and thus a well-set hotbed for gentrification to occur p.2368

- Similarly an older piece but useful gentrification definition and includes different ways of looking at the problem
<br>

Definitional way of lookng at gentrification
- Sees gentrification comprised of two processes: 1. "the class based colonisation of cheaper residential neighbourhoods" 2. "a reinvestment in the physical housing stock" p.2343-2344
- This is the most agreed definition- some argue displacement is a necessary factor, others not. Some have debated whether the habitation of vacant/ derelict property included in the term
- This author argues that the "fundamental stamp of gentrification is the tracking of new settlement patterns of the middle classes. Detailing where members of this group move, conveyed by outward-looking social networks and financial resources, and the differential effectsthis has" - so a targetted analysis of middle-class resettlement p. 2344
- For lose on the political left- "insidious vanguard", dislocatng social problems and problem people
- Those partial to market solutions use neutral terms- neighbourhood revitalisation/ renaissance
- Realtors/ those wanting to boost the city- choice portrayed aa s between growth in declining city or continued social and physical decline p.2344
  <br>
  <br>

Political way of looking at gentrification (who it affects and what should be done about it) 
- Whether it represents a problem at all has been debated p.2344
- Gentrification represents a corrosive influence
- The key social groups that benefit from new economies, both financial and e-commerce, have been at the forefront of social changes
- Gentrification transforms the character or run down areas- households have fewer choices in "hot property markets", they are displaced through rent increases and unable to secure another local dwelling
- So the problem is the  social cost of local household dislocation and the difficulty of re-entering the inner city
- On political right- displacement "has been acknowledged but seen as an unfortunate corollary of processes that are revitalising city centres, attracting private investment and securing the physical fabric of architecturally valuable neighbourhoods"- they ignore the social cost as it prevents city decline/ decaying neighbourhoods/ dwindling local tax bases
- Leads to question of whether these benefits are justified given the social costs involved
- But it is often not a net gain of population as gentrifiers tend to come from the same city- so it is not a fiscal gift as some see it
- "A review of all the English-language empirical research from 1964 to 2001 (Atkinson, 2002) revealed that gentrification has largely negaative impacts on neighbourhoods p.2345

### Newcastle: Ltd (2023) *The Gentrification And Urban Development Of Newcastle Upon Tyne*. Available at: https://newcastle.ltd/the-gentrification-and-urban-development-of-newcastle-upon-tyne/ (Accessed: 31 March 2024).
- This website details specific impacts and signifiers of gentrification in Newcastle

<br>

- Newcastle has undergone significant transformation in recent years
- Signifiers of gentrification= "physical infrastructure, cultural composition, and socioeconomic status of the area" para.2
<br>

Impact on housing and real estate 
- Visbible signifier of gentrification= city housing and real estate market
- New residential developments that have sprung up, which cater to high demands of modern upscaled living spaces. para.3
- Former industrial sites like Ouseburn Valley and Quayside have been repurposed into trendy waterfront apartments and creative hubs (but some argue creativity is lost (there are many news articles detailing this))
- They were once factories/ warehouses and now they attract professionals and artists, changing the demographic makeup of neighbourhoods para.4
- Rise in property values and rents- concerns about housing affordability, making it difficult for low-income individuals to remain in their neighbourhoods,  and displacement of longterm residents. para.5
  <Br>

Cultural scene revitalised/ urban renewal
- Specifically in areas of Jesmond and Ouseburn
- They are popular destinations for locals and tourists as they now have thriving food and beverage scenes and vibrants arts/ musical festivals
- This has brought new cultural experiences and economic opportunities to the city. para.7
- But the negative side- "new cultural attractions also risk erasing the identity of the original communities and pushing out local businesses that can no longer afford to operate in the face of rising rents and competition." para.8
<br>

Improved infrastructure and public spaces
- Particularly the Quayside area
- Due to NE1 developments: https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ne1+developments&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
- Revitalised with public art installations, modernised infrastructure. para.9
- Boosts local economy and attracts visitors/ businessness/ creates job opportunites. para.10
- But can argue these changes benefit primarily wealthier populations, neglecting the needs of low income residents who can't take advantage of new developments. para.11
<br>

Community resistance to gentrification
- Community groups/ organisations have voiced concerns about displacement of long-term residents, rising inequality, and the loss of affordable housng and local businesses. para.12
- This bit is relevant to our project: "it is important for [...] community members to work together to implement measures that prioritize inclusivity and equitable development. This may involve the implementation of affordable housing policies, the preservation of cultural heritage, and the promotion of local ownership and businesses." para.13

- Not an academic source but clearly showcases the impacts of gentrification on the Newcastle area specific buldings/ architecture
- A more modern take on this would be for us to look at NE1 developments and regeneration initiatives

### Medium (2018) *Student Gentrification*. Available at: https://medium.com/@3pointohnine/student-gentrification-fc5e316e3280 (Accessed: 31 March 2024).
- Ouseburn is a major victim of gentrification and has seen a huge influx of new student accomodation being built
- The poem cited in this could be used as an example of one of the tenants' submissions
- There are various of protests and petitions aimed at preventing the gentrification of Newcastle (can just search and many come up eg. on Change.org)
- Byker is also a victim: https://newcastleareas.wordpress.com/byker/byker-a-way-forward/
