  root((Existing project solutions fall short of humanising the client's problems and fail to convey the full extent of emotional tolls and data-backed experiences of tenants))
    Historic relevance and signficance of zine culture
      Incorporate elements of zine culture in developing our Digital Community        Zine app
      Adopt an advocacy/ community-led approach
      Self-published, personal, and critical narratives
    Using interactive literature and data to truly empower tenants
      Research traditional conventions- will we do something that subverts this/ does something different?
    Digital Storytelling
     Including qualitative and quantitative data
    Means of collecting any data that we need
      How we would get tenant's submissions
      What would the tenant submissions process look like?
   Interactive map
    Could we use UK data service? Kml files
    Include point-based data on top of area data? Need to consider a meaningful way of organising space/ why we decide to organise the area space in a certain way
    Zoom in and out feature- need to consider at what point do the data points aggregate together
    Electoral ward boundaries? Or a more arbritary approach where we decide the mapping of areas
