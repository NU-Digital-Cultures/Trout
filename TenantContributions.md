  # How we envision tenants contributing to TenantTalk 

 **What contribution will tenants make?**
 - Tenants will upload personal submissions to TenantTalk via our app
 - Submissions can include written extracts, images, videos, artwork, poetry etc. As - points, within digital storytelling
 - For photos/ artwork, our app will allow users to upload photos from their camera roll/ take pictures of their artwork
 - Perhaps we could even allow uploads from Polycam or of 360 photos to showcase 3D perspectives of tenants' artwork/ photographic and videographic experiences. Almost like a 'visual diary' can be uploaded

**How will tenants submissions be represented?**
  - As our app provides a digital storytelling feature for users to utilse, our app also consequently dictates the means by which tenants' stories are told. As Dush highlights, being a 'sponsor' to the storytelling of someone else's experience can lead to "appropriating someone else's story if they are not given creative control at all moments." Dush, 2012, p.631
  - Therefore, TenantTalk allows for tenants to represent their submissions in various ways/ utilise different mediums of conveying their personal realities, which permits self-dictation over how their stories are told and by what means
  - We will also think critically and evaluate throughout the process our role as storyteller facilitators 

  **How will tenants' submissions to the app be presented on our interactive map and on our app interface?**
  - As a pop-up when the user hovers over/ clicks upon a property or area
  - Idea that responses will be tied/ geographically linked to the area they were submitted from/ perhaps even property that they were submitted about
  - In this sense, the app becomes a knowledge hub of quantitative and quantitative data on tenants' experiences and the reality of renting in a particular area :warning:
    
**How will we ensure that what is represented by our interactive map truthfully reflects and optimally conveys tenants' experiences/ personal stories related to renting?**
- We will create and release a Survey using Optimal Workshop
- The Survey will ask respondents what information they would like to know before commiting to a tenancy on a property, or perhaps what they would have liked to know
- The Survey will include a combination 

**Criteria of tenants' submissions**
- As priorly stated, submissions to the app will be considered flexibly, however submissions also need to be somehwhat constrained by certain criteria to make sure they are relevant to the content we want to display on our app
- This could be achieved by our app providing prompts/ tick box options that users could expand upon. These would be based off the responses received from the Optimal Worskhop Survey
- We would need some kind of check on responses and perhaps a verification process
