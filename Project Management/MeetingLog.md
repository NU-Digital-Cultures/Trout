# Meeting Log
## Meeting 1 - 20/02/24 @  2pm in Phillip Robinson Library
- We mainly discussed which of the briefs we preferred
- We went around the group and asked which were each persons top 3 out of the briefs
- After mixed opinions we took the top two voted briefs and discussed ideas for how we would go about them and decided we had more ideas about the Homes for Newcastle project
- We created a document which aired out initial ideas about our project- see 'InitalIdeas.md' also in this folder
- Initial foundational ideas we had were based around taking inspiration from Uber Eats' ratings system, but how this could be implicated for landlords
- We discussed the creation of an app, for which we could create a prototype for using Adobe XD (which some of us had prior experience using)
- Our aim could be to create a new industry standard of criteria for landlords

## Meeting 2 - 27/02/24 @ 2pm in Philip Robinson Library
- Main focus was on completing Formative so we gathered ideas for our project
- Confirmed that we are planning on creating an app
	- For the presentation we could use visual aids to present the data
	- Interactive map
	- Rating criteria as an incentive for landlords to improve. Based on pricing, living conditions, location, landlord communication, how long they have owned the property, then 'other'
	- Survey/interviews to collect rating criteria labels/what people would like to see from the app
	- In terms of sourcing the data - users inputting data themselves on the app
	- Require verified tenant identities to prevent review bombing
	- Advice hub/knowledge platform
	- Tasks
		○ Look at what research literature already exists to give a sense of what is possible or useful - student unions etc.
		○ Research multitude existing projects to take inspiration from - find things that exist, critique what is there, and find the gap that exists
		○ Data legislations that could be at play with the data we collect
		○ Research the ethical questions surrounding the legal frameworks/ethics of using data
		○ Providing a service has different regulations to lobbying (CIC rules)

Meeting 3 - 12th March 2024
2pm - Henry Daysh Building
	- Discussed project criteria and made decision to focus on a campaign to support HfN not create our own research project as initially discussed 
	- Created GitHub project for tasks
	- Outlined tasks required and assigned them to people
	- Discussing using Adobe XD for prototype and Canva
	- Possibility of a direct translation feature on page
	- Created a mood board on Canva
	- Thinking more of an interactive webpage instead of app
	- Like click on a person's face to see their story etc.
	- Final idea was to create an interactive digital zine to support the campaign
	- Tasks
		○ Researching zine culture
		○ Context analysis on housing in Newcastle - expertise not needed
		○ Zine research - previous styles, content etc.
		○ Research possible platforms for the zine
		○ Start a log of research and discussions for future report and bibliography
		○ Create a survey for context analysis - quantitative and qualitative questions
		○ Define the problem using academic literature (bad landlords and gentrification)
		○ Research into the problem of gentrification or exposing bad landlords
		○ Decide on which problem we are going to tackle and why: students or immigrants, exposing bad landlords or gentrification?
		○ Research on interactive literature - do we follow a linear narrative approach or something more subversive/subvert the expectation of the zine?
		○ Create a clear problem statement
		○ Create Mermaid Mindmap of ideas
		○ Decide on the design of the app: aesthetics, layout, interactivity, information included etc.
		○ Create a meeting log
		○ Research CIC and how their campaigns work
		○ Expand mood board for design
