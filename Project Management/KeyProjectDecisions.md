| We could make some kind of landlord rating system/ complaints system to submit formal complaints against landlords | We liked this idea but felt it was very 2D, it wouldn't lead to our campaign to producing productive results if all it was based on was processing complaints. The brief is also to create a campaign to support HtN, not a solution to the problem itself. Further, it would be hard to implement, as we would be entering tricky legal terrain and considering we have no relevant legal role it would be hard for us to get involved and help tenants. This is beyond the scope of this project |
| The app should be made on figma rather than Adobe XD | Upheld- After using Figma, it is a lot easier to navigate and its features enable what we want to create (see meeting 5 also for this) |
| The map will have different filters informed by the survey results/ the map should show multiple data ie. indicate gentrification, then where bad landlords are, and so on... |Discarded- difficult to implement in coding and the logistics of determining bad landlords per area is flawed. Bad landlords would be beter exemplified in the tenant tales and gentrification showcased by the map. A further addition is that the tenant tales should also be linked to the map to make it serve multiple purposes|
| The map will be organised by areas of Newcastle and will display rent data | Upheld- this is achievable in terms of coding, is informative, would be useful for student tenants to have, and looks effective |
| The tenant stories will be attached to the particular property spoken about | Discarded- upon reflection this could cause a major ethical issue: if the landlord was to see the review they could treat tenants poorly or worse evict tthe tenants. We need to rethink this process |
| The app will have 4 main buttons on the home page leading to key sections of 'Tenant Tales', 'Local Rent Prices', 'YourNewcastle', and 'Tenant Handbook' | Discarded- we realised that the 4 sections we created would overlap in terms of the content we would want to include on each section. Also, this approach separates tenant stories/ 'Tenant Tales' from the map which defeats the purpose of the map |
| The app will have buttons on the home page| Discarded- the idea of buttons acts in line with app tradition and what we want to create is something that is subversive and has a meaningful social and political presence. So we will change the look of the buttons so that they don't look like buttons and are instead embedded within the visual design of the home page |
| The app will have 3 main buttons on the home page leading to key sections of 'Tenant Tales' (now linking to the map), 'Tenant Handbook', and 'Tenant Roundup' | Upheld- this condensed version is more effective as the sections are more meaningful in that they will contain more distinct content |
| The theme of the app will be based on visuals of Newcastle to clearly convey that it is an app for this area | Discarded- this acts against our zine approach. The visuals should be more 'DIY'-y/ maybe even a cartoon-like appearance, and will look like a magazine but subverted for non-commercial purposes. Also, visuals of Newcastle do not do much to convey the aims of the app, whereas our own self-created visuals would be more effective at this |
| The 'Tenant Handbook' will look like a magazine article, with catchy titles and news-like paragraph format of conveying relevant tenant information | Discarded- when attempting this format, it felt quite rigid and large volumes of texts may be offputting for the user and unattractive to read and look at |
| The 'Tenant Handbook' will be more interactive and will look like an image ie. a house with embedded links within the visuals to different resources/ information | Potentially upheld- this fits in more with the theme if our opening page and is an innovative, clear, visually appealing way of displaying essential tenant information |
