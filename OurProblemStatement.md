**Our problem statement=** 
"Existing project solutions aiming to tackle gentrification and poor landlord practices commonly adopt an information-based and advisory approach to supporting tenants, most conventionally presented as 'knowledge-hubs' in the form of a website or app. 
However, these approaches are limited in that they fall short of humanising the socio-economic problems and conveying to a full extent the human emotional toll and data-backed experiences of tenants. 
Existing projects are particularly lacking the inclusion of qualitative data to supplement their use of quantitative. 
To truly empower tenants, incorporating digital storytelling would bridge such qualitative gaps in knowledge. 
Fundamentally, what is required, and what we have determined as most appropriately suiting the client's aims, is a community-anchored and advocacy-based approach to our project: making visible the problem of gentrification and revealing unethical landlord practices through means of conveying both widespread data stories and personal real-life, real-time qualitative tenant 'stories'. 
The client's two agendas lend well to traditional storytelling approaches, yet, we desire to push this boundary further by adopting a different variety of digital, data-led, and diverse storytelling approaches to be fully inclusive of the different ways that stories can be captured and told."
