## First Draft of App Design
This was the first attempt to create the tenant talk app, and served as the foundation for the final product.  Both positive and negative elements were identified, and were taken into consideration when designing the final version of the app. 

**Kept**

- The sign-in box was taken and adapted to the final design. 
-  The general user journey was kept the same.

**Revised**

- The team agreed that the aesthetic of the app was visually heavy, and so a more basic design was favoured to allow greater focus on the content of the app.
