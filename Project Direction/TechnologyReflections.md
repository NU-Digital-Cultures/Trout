# Reflection
Reasons why we made the decisions we did surrounding our digital platform and technologies used.
<br>

## Technology
### Figma
- "Figma is a collaborative web application for interface design" ('Figma', 2024)  created in 2016. It is used to create prototypes for digital interfaces such as websites, apps, and in our case, zines. It works similarly to programs such as Adobe XD, but we chose Figma for our project as we have has less problems with it in the past, it was a platform we were familiar with using, and it would allow us to create the prototype for our app exactly how we wanted it.
- Upon reflection, there are a few different platforms we could have used instead. We could have created a html for our zine instead of a prototype, but we felt creating a prototype to show exactly how our zine will work interactively would serve our project aims better.

### GitHub
- We chose GitHub to organise our project and research as it is "used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects." (Juliver, 2024).
