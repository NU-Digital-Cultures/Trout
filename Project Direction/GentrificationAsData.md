    Gentrification
      Data signifiers of gentrification
        Data illustrating increased rent prices per area would showcases higher unaffordability of living in the city
          A visible signifier of gentrification is city housing and the real estate market which showcase rise in property values and rents. Newcastle:Ltd, 2023, para.3
        Data showing migration of individuals/ households out of the city would illustrate of displacement of existing lower-income/ lower-/ working class populations. Cameron, 2003, p.2372
          As the "fundamental stamp of gentrification is the tracking of new settlement patterns of the middle classes." Atkinson ,2003, p.2344
          Or, could approach from the opposite angle and include data showing migrantion into the city of more affluent households/ middle-classes
          Targetted analysis of middle class resettlement
        Data of anti-social behaviour/ crime- they signify more vacant areas. Caameron ,2003, p.2368
          Population data
        Highlighting areas that have been revitalised/ regenerated to look/ serve a more 'modern' economic function
        Househould data
          Data showing the demographic make-up of particular areas
            Cultural composition/ socioeconomic status of the area. Newcastle:Ltd, 2023, para.2
            Data on household incomes that might indicate the social class of a household- as Ouseburn has become more of a "middle-class constituency." Whitling and Hannam, 2017, p.318
        Data showing whether households are made up of "owner-occupiers" or "social tenants." Cameron, 2003, p.2372
        Highlght areas that have undergone recent investment- this is where rent prices are likely higher. Atkinson, 2003, pp.2343-2344
        Gentrification "cannot solely be understood as a process of displacement, but is also clearly linked to the growth modes of regulation and commercialisation in social space." Whiting and Hannam, 2017, p.318
          So maybe find data related to these factors?
        

      Social impacts of gentrification
        Look at relocation policies adopted by the city council. Cameron, 2003, p.2372
        Show where local identities and original communities have been replaced, which are some of the primary negative effects on gentrification. para.8
          Show how area competition impacts on humans intimate, emotionally, and socially, as well as just economically
