# Our Project's 'Problem Statement' üõ†Ô∏è
## This statement is generated based on our evaluations of existing projects
<br>

"Existing project solutions aiming to tackle gentrification and unethical landlord practices commonly adopt an information-based and advisory approach to supporting tenants, most conventionally presented as 'knowledge-hubs' or heavy information dumps on websites and apps. However, we feel that these approaches are limited in that they fall short of humanising the problems; they do not stay much in touch with real-life qualitative data experiences of tenants nor do they convey the full extent of the more abstract human emotional tolls experienced by tenants in the renting market. **Tenant Talk** desires to therefore draw upon what the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project achieved in their 'Tenants Rise Up!' section, that is, using qualitative data to supplement quantitative in order to fully capture the tenant experience. Existing projects are also particularly lacking the inclusion of qualitative data to supplement their use of quantitative. **Tenant Talk** will adopt a digital storytelling approach, with the aim of facilitating data advocacy: making the problems of poor landlord practices and gentrification processes visible through qualitative and quantitative data experiences. This will be supplemented by knowledge resources for tenants that are educational about student renting issues, as we feel it is not enough just to facilitate a digital 'tenant community' on **Tenant Talk**, but that- like a community- tenants feel supported by and empowered with the tools to navigate Newcastle's renting market. What we ultimately aim to create is complete, collective, and digital tenant identity which acts in line with our current media-saturated society. The client's two agendas lend well to traditional storytelling approaches, yet, we desire to push this boundary further by adopting a different variety of diverse digital storytelling approaches to be fully inclusive of the different ways that stories can be captured and told."
