**Problem statement=** 
"Existing project solutions aiming to tackle gentrification and unethical landlord practices commonly adopt an information-based and advisory approach to supporting tenants, most conventionally presented as 'knowledge-hubs' in the form of a website or app. 
However, these approaches are limited in that they fall short of humanising these political, economic, and social problems; they do not convey to a full extent the human emotional toll and data-backed experiences of tenants. 
Existing projects are also particularly lacking the inclusion of qualitative data to supplement their use of quantitative. 
We will adopt a digital storytelling approach to bridge this gap in data, with the aim of partaking in data advocacy, which will  work towards empowering tenants through making the problems they have suffered  visible and through creating/ fostering the production of a shared tenant identity/ vernacular. This will be supplemented by knowledge resources for tenants that are educational about student renting issues, as we feel it is not enough just to facilitate a digital 'tenant community' on TenantTalk, but that- like a community- tenants feel supported by and empowered with the tools to navigate Newcastle's renting market.
Fundamentally, what is required, and what we have determined as most appropriately suiting the client's aims, is a community-anchored and data advocacy-based approach to our project: bringing to the forefront the problems of gentrification and poor landlord practices through means of conveying both broader quantitative data stories and personal qualitative tenant 'stories'. 
The client's two agendas lend well to traditional storytelling approaches, yet, we desire to push this boundary further by adopting a different variety of diverse digital storytelling approaches to be fully inclusive of the different ways that stories can be captured and told."
