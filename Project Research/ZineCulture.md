  root((We intend to incorporate the theoretical and historical ideas underpinning zine culture and use them as a useful framing device for our project.))
    What is a zine?
      Self-published, personal, and critical narratives
      Zines emerged as a form of self-published, small-circulation publications often created by enthusiasts, artists, or activists to share their ideas, artwork, or opinions
      Viewers are guided through the zine with eye-popping imagery and busy visuals- we could put these together digitally
      Traditionally, zines have been "small, self-published works made up of collages and images and texts" which have "notoriously acted as methods of expression and communication for socially-outcasted or marginalised communities." Heins, 2022, para.2-3
        Given the client's aims and our advocacy-based approach to supporting their campaign, tenants can be theorised a marginalised and subjugated community at the hands of landlords and their partaking in gentrification processes. Thus, by calling upon zines as a framework, we can establish a more empowered 'tenant community'.
    Why do we want to include ideas from zines?
      Heins stipulates that the cultural impact that zines have historically been able to produce is arguably more suited for effective use now in our digital contemporary society. 2022, para.1
      Permits formulation of a niche digital community by which tenants can express themselves and their tenant identities/ experiences through their own creative and self-dictated means
      The fact that a zine is a "material artefact" allowing for a "personalised remixing of ideas" through its "deconstructed and deconstructing nature" means that tenants' experiences and their personal stories do not just occur and then are blown into the wind and forgotten. They are captured by the tenant in their own form and then materially encapsulated on our app in order to promote effective, social change. Therefore, zines could be an effective means for pursuing advocacy in our project. Brown et al., 2021, p.1
      Zines offer "inclusive" and a "firmly emancipatory approach" to activism by historically providing an "intellectual space outside of the mainstream." Brown et al., 2021, p.1-2
      Zines can provide almost limitless creative possibilities when it comes to addressing the social side of the topic, creative process, and the hysical construction of the zine itself.
      Creating a zine could invoke passionate responses from respondents, as it has worked traditionally as a means of creative self expression of niche communities/ independent publishing
