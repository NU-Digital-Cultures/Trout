# Our TenantTalk app's overarching aim is to establish a tenant community, identity, and 'vernacular' sort-of-speak
## Tenant identity
Foucault's 'technologies of the self' are means of identity formation

### McKinlay, A. and Starkey, K. P. (1997) *Foucault, management and organization theory from panopticon to technologies of the self*. London: Sage Publications.
- Foucault contributes to social theory through producing ways of deconstructing what it means to be a modern subject
- Individuals and groups define themselves through 'technologies of the self'
- "Through these practices, individuals and groups embody forms of action that 'free' themselves from what they consider intolerable in their current situation and thus define their own limits." - p.214
- This theory works well with the fact we are providing a self-dictated digital space for tenants whereby they can subvert and dictate new ways of producing power dynamics in relation to their current renting situations (critique of their landlord, critique of gentrification etc.)
- The technologies set new boundaries of self-discipline and through interacting and self-regulation with these technologies, a collective 'tenant identity' can form

### Foucault, M (1988) 'Technologies of the self', in L. H. Martin, H. Gutman and P. Huton (eds), *Technologies of the Self: A Seminar with Michael Foucault.* London: Tavistock, pp. 16-49.
- Idea of fostering a new ontology onto ourselves via ethical practices. These practices have "the neccessity of excavating our own culture in order to open a free space for innovation and creativity" - p.163
- Tenant submissions will be creative
- Our app should provide an alternative avenue for tenants whereby they are permitted to innovatively storytell their struggles. The idea of providing a platform which provides a space for tenants to reconsider and redefine their struggles on their own terms allows them to 'claim back' (ethical) power within their specific situations
- Tenants enacting this in mass will lead to a certain level of consciousness shared among users, in other words, leading to a collective 'tenant identity' production
