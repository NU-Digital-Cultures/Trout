# We need to consider what it means to tell (tenant) stories through technology


## Metro Futures is a project we could take inspiration from
### Bowen, S., Wright, P., Wilson, A., Dow, A., Bartindale, T. and Anderson, R.

- This project aims to facilitate and increase citizen engagement via digital media tools with the proposed designs of new metro trains
- Idea of citizen collaborative design and contribution to inform design plans
- This is the project's results: https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjigsaudio.com%2Fexplore%2F&data=05%7C02%7CB.Brooks3%40newcastle.ac.uk%7Cdb75ccf99a044be06d2308dc68323569%7C9c5012c9b61644c2a91766814fbe3e87%7C1%7C0%7C638499812041810821%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xUXeR23DGOMLLOHAew59q5fVejl2YxJG3bvwHyIaAD0%3D&reserved=0

- Although used as part of design consultations, this project adopts a digital media approach which enables co-design. In a similar vein, we could use our app as a digital tool to enable a sharing of tenant experiences through interactive digital formats, enabling co-forming of a collective 'tenant identity'
- Although very simple, this approach very **arbritrary** and could be an effective means of tenant storytelling 

 The project uses JigsAudio technology: 
 ### Wilson, A. and Tewdwr-Jones, M. (2020) 'Lets draw and talk about urban change: Deploying digital technology to encourage citizen participation in urban planning', *Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science*, 47(9), pp. 1588-1604. Availabe at: https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808319831290 
- It aims to encourage citizen participation in urban planning and for regional change
- Enables discussion of "feelings that may be too difficult or complex to communicate through traditional planning engagement methods alone" so JigsAudio was made as an alternative way of expression/ communication of feelings
- Similarly, **personal experiences and feelings are very complex and may be best captured through alternative means to just words (audio and drawings, etc)**
- Focuses on conducting research 'in the wild' (they went out into the public space to deploy JigsAudio (metro-themed pop-up events at transport hubs) rather than conducting controlled lab studies as it has been proven more effective))
- **We would similarly be doing this via an app as tenants will be uploading submissions in real time about the property they are potentially living in at the time**
- The jigaw pieces of the public's feelings and experiences were then made to resemble metro carriages that could be joined together to form a single train
- **We could adopt this idea of creatively embedding the visuals of the probems/ project into the project outcomes/ way the project is presented** 
- JigsAudio's aims: 1) "by utilising a technique that allowed people to draw, write and discuss their thoughts visually, the aim was to allow participants to communicate more complicated thoughts than prose alone would allow."; 2) "by keeping the technology easy to use, it ‘contribute[s] to users skipping over the part where they contemplate whether they should interact at all’ (Steinberger et al., 2014: 49) and encourages participation."; "by displaying the resulting jigsaw it was hoped that more people would become engaged with the activity through seeing a novel approach to engagement."
- This project concluded that these three aims were met. **We could apply this accredited methodology to TenantTalk** as it promotes the communication/ expression of feelings otherwise inexpressible by words, or not best captured by words, in more abstract forms, and practice itself and the visualisation of the results successfully promoted engagement with the technology and the project
