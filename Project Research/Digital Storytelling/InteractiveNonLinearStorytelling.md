# Interactive and Non-Linear Digital Storytelling
<br>

We need to consider what it means to tell (student tenant) stories through digital technological means üßë‚Äçüíª
<br>


## A project unrelated to our topic but is nevertheless a project we could take inspiration from in terms of its non-linear, interactive storytelling approach: 'Metro Futures'
### Bowen, S., Wright, P., Wilson, A., Dow, A., Bartindale, T. and Anderson, R.

- This project aims to facilitate and increase citizen engagement via digital media tools with the proposed designs of new metro trains
- Idea of citizen collaborative design and contribution to inform design plans
- This is the project's results: https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjigsaudio.com%2Fexplore%2F&data=05%7C02%7CB.Brooks3%40newcastle.ac.uk%7Cdb75ccf99a044be06d2308dc68323569%7C9c5012c9b61644c2a91766814fbe3e87%7C1%7C0%7C638499812041810821%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=xUXeR23DGOMLLOHAew59q5fVejl2YxJG3bvwHyIaAD0%3D&reserved=0

- Although used as part of design consultations, this project adopts a digital media approach which enables co-design. In a similar vein, we could use our app as a digital tool to enable a **co-sharing of tenant experiences**
- Although very simple, this approach very **arbritrary** and could be an effective means of tenant storytelling 

 ## The project uses JigsAudio technology: 
 ### Wilson, A. and Tewdwr-Jones, M. (2020) 'Lets draw and talk about urban change: Deploying digital technology to encourage citizen participation in urban planning', *Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science*, 47(9), pp. 1588-1604. Availabe at: https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808319831290 
- JigdAudio was made as an alternative means of expression and communication. It enables the discussion of "feelings that may be too difficult or complex" to communicate through just words
- Similarly, tenant personal experiences and feelings will also be very complex. It may be useful for us to also **permit tenant submissions in various, more abstract formats** such as audio/ visual works, artwork, poems, etc.
- Focuses on conducting research 'in the wild' (they went out into the public space to deploy JigsAudio (metro-themed pop-up events at transport hubs) rather than conducting controlled lab studies as it has been proven more effective))
- We would similarly be doing this via an app as tenants will be uploading submissions in real time about the property they are potentially living in at the time
- The jigaw pieces of the public's feelings and experiences were then made to resemble metro carriages that could be joined together to form a single train
- **We could adopt this idea of creatively embedding the visuals of the probems/ project into the project outcomes/ way the project is presented**
<br>

- JigsAudio's aims: 1) "by utilising a technique that allowed people to draw, write and discuss their thoughts visually, the aim was to allow participants to communicate more complicated thoughts than prose alone would allow."; 2) "by keeping the technology easy to use, it ‚Äòcontribute[s] to users skipping over the part where they contemplate whether they should interact at all‚Äô (Steinberger et al., 2014: 49) and encourages participation."; "by displaying the resulting jigsaw it was hoped that more people would become engaged with the activity through seeing a novel approach to engagement."
- This project concluded that these three aims were met. **We could apply this accredited methodology to Tenant Talk**

## Non-Linear Storytelling 
- This approach to storytelling would be useful in our presentation of the tenant tales given that tenant submissions will be varied in content, perspectives, and will be relevant to different specific areas situations, and personal timelines
- Via a map, users can select on different areas of Newcastle and receive a **non-linear, abstract, 'structured dump'** of tenant stories, allowing the user to unravel the narrative of that area of their own accord. This works with our non-commercial approach of developing the app (not enforcing users to follow a specific path/ perform a particular 'money-making'/ preferential function)

## Interactive Storytelling
### Smed, J., Suovuo, T., Skult, N. and Skult, P. (2021) *Handbook on Interactive Storytelling*. West Sussex: Wiley.
- The 'Perspectives' chapter of the book explores different perspectives in the digital storytelling space (ie. on different platforms) and ties it relative to predicted trends of interactive storytelling in the future
- Although we are not introducing characters or interplay elements as such, as this would feel to  be 'making light' out of a seriously motivated campaign, a lot of the same principles apply to our interactive storytelling
- In terms of our platform, "the designer [us] has the burden of defining its ethical dimension" p. 163- so the way in which we **present the stories** must be thoroughly and ethically considered
- Interactive storytelling can also be a "tool for political, religious, or cultural propaganda" and this storytelling appraoch can be "even more effective as it possiblly immerses the interactor even deeper into the storyworld" p.164- we must therefore be aware of the **political/ generally influencing potential** that our app might possess in terms of its interactivity and ensure the content on our app is held to high standards- perhaps **verification** process of submissions needed?
