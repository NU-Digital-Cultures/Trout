 # Essential knowledge on student renting experiences ‼️
 
<br>

## Types of student renting pathways:
### Rugg, J., Ford, J. and Burrows, R. (2006) 'Housing advantage? The role of student renting in the consitution of housing biographies in the United Kingdom', *Journal of Youth Studies*, 7(1), pp. 19-34. Available at: https://doi-org.libproxy.ncl.ac.uk/10.1080/1367626042000209930
- Centres upon the idea of a new student leaving their home environment and moving out
- Useful due to its focus on the operation of economic and housing market constraints
- Constucts typologies of different student renting pathways, of which we are concerned with the **3rd**

  <br>
  
  Directly quoting phrases from the article here...
  - 1st pathway= "*chaotic* pathway": limitied planning; absense of family support perhaps due to domestic disputes with parents; left home at early age; limited financial resources so cannot access accomodation in PRS; moves between staying with family members, serial hostel stays, may sleep on street; spatial reach of pathway restricted to particular town/ city
  - 2nd= '*unplanned* pathwaay': no planning; some family support as move supported by family; move is unexpected; limited financial support; may access PRS
  - 3rd= '*constrained* pathway': clear planning; family support; move closer to work; move into PRS; constraints experienced in labour and housing market; potential protracted stay in the parental home because of the lack of available and affordable properties on the owner-occpied market/ PRS; inability to secure reasonably paid, no long-term employment; unable to get mortgage; *steep property price increase are an obstacle for these first-time buyers/ renters*; *geographically bound to a location due to work commitments*
  - ↘️ **This 3rd path is applicable to our project:**
  - **Our project will focus on students who experience constraints in the renting market due to their inability to have long-term employment due to university commitments. These students are moving away from home and struggle to find affordable properties (due to gentrified areas in Newcastle).They may have family support which can be relied upon in times of economic hardship in terms of paying their rent**
  - 4th= '*planned non-student* pathway': substantial planning; few/ managable constraints; delayed leaving of parental home due to limited economic resources/ family formation; could by property with a partner on city outskirts; geographic boundaries limited
