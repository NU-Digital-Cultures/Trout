 # Essential knowledge on student renting experiences ‼️
 
<br>

## Types of student renting pathways:
### Rugg, J., Ford, J. and Burrows, R. (2006) 'Housing advantage? The role of student renting in the consitution of housing biographies in the United Kingdom', *Journal of Youth Studies*, 7(1), pp. 19-34. Available at: https://doi-org.libproxy.ncl.ac.uk/10.1080/1367626042000209930
- Centres upon the idea of a new student leaving their home environment and moving out
- Useful due to its focus on the operation of economic and housing market constraints
- Constucts typologies of different student renting pathways, of which we are concerned with the **3rd**
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Directly quoting phrases from the article here...
  - 1st pathway= "*chaotic* pathway": limitied planning; absense of family support perhaps due to domestic disputes with parents; left home at early age; limited financial resources so cannot access accomodation in PRS; moves between staying with family members, serial hostel stays, may sleep on street; spatial reach of pathway restricted to particular town/ city
  - 2nd= '*unplanned* pathwaay': no planning; some family support as move supported by family; move is unexpected; limited financial support; may access PRS
  - 3rd= '*constrained* pathway': clear planning; family support; move closer to work; move into PRS; constraints experienced in labour and housing market; potential protracted stay in the parental home because of the lack of available and affordable properties on the owner-occpied market/ PRS; inability to secure reasonably paid, no long-term employment; unable to get mortgage; *steep property price increase are an obstacle for these first-time buyers/ renters*; *geographically bound to a location due to work commitments*
  - ↘️ **This 3rd path is applicable to our project:**
  - **Our project will focus on students who experience constraints in the renting market due to their inability to have long-term employment due to university commitments. These students are moving away from home and struggle to find affordable properties (due to gentrified areas in Newcastle).They may have family support which can be relied upon in times of economic hardship in terms of paying their rent**
  - 4th= '*planned non-student* pathway': substantial planning; few/ managable constraints; delayed leaving of parental home due to limited economic resources/ family formation; could by property with a partner on city outskirts; geographic boundaries limited

## Key debates surrounding student renting
<h2>https://news.sky.com/story/student-rent-strike-campaigns-gathering-pace-against-exploitation-10581250</h2>
<br> 
This debate in this website is based on a <b>rent dispute</b> between students at Goldsmiths University of London and the company Campus Living Villages (CLV)
<br> 
<h3>Stance of the tenants living in Raymont Hall, Goldsmiths University of London</h3>
<br> 
1. Shannon Howard and other Goldsmiths undergraduates expressed their frustration with high rents by refusing to pay rent to the Campus Living Villages (CLV), a private company that upkeeps Raymont Hall.
<br> 
2. Students organised a two-day workshop aimed at developing strategies for running a successful rent strike campaign on campuses across the UK.
<br> 
3. Shannon Howard said that her involvement in the rent strike was not just about rent, but about principle, and that she believed that people's welfare should be prioritised over profit.
<br> 
<h3>Stance of the Campus Living Villages (CLV)</h3>
<br> 
1. CLV demanded by letter, email and voicemail that Miss Shannon Howard need to pay the outstanding rent totalling £1,471.24.
<br>
2. CLV says that if a student is officially registered as a rent striker by the university, then they will not receive a rent recovery letter.
<br>
3. George Spencer, CEO of CLV, said that the rents are "much lower level than they are in the private sector." And he added  "These are students who are unwilling to pay their rent, not unable to pay their rent. If they were unable to pay their rent then the market would correct itself, and we'd see more affordable accommodation built."

## What students should know about their tenants right
<h3>https://www.savethestudent.org/accommodation/what-are-your-rights-as-a-tenant.html</h3>
1. Be aware if the landlord owns an House in Multiple Occupation(HMO)
<br> 
2. Be aware that the landlord is required by law to install at least one smoke alarm and fire extinguisher on each floor, and a carbon monoxide detector where there is a combustion furnace
<br> 
3. The landlord can only enter your property in the event of an emergency, e.g. fire, burglary, etc. Otherwise the landlord can only enter the property with 24 hours' notice.
<br> 
4. Your landlord is responsible for most major repairs, including any faults with:
<br> 
- The structure of the property (the walls, roof, windows and doors)
<br> 
- Sinks, baths and toilets
<br> 
- Pipes and wiring
<br> 
- Heating and hot water (including the boiler)
<br> 
- The safety of gas and electrical appliances.
<br> 
5. There are a number of reasons why a landlord could legally evict you, including the following:
<br> 
-Being at least two months late on rent payments
<br> 
-Being regularly late with your payments
<br> 
-Breaching any of the terms of your tenancy agreement
<br> 
-Letting the property fall into an unacceptable state
<br> 
-Subletting a room without permission
<br> 
-Causing serious nuisance to the neighbours
<br> 
-Using the property for illegal purposes, such as dealing drugs
<br> 
-Refusing to leave the property at the end of your contract.
