 # Essential knowledge on student renting experiences ‼️
 This file contains information about the typology of student renting we are aiming to support and empower via Tenant Talk, student grassroot campaigns that already exist in relation to the renting market/ housing crisis, key tenant renting debates currently circulating, and links to information pertaining to recent updates made to tenant and landlord rights and responsibilites in  the UK

## Types of student renting pathways:
### Rugg, J., Ford, J. and Burrows, R. (2006) 'Housing advantage? The role of student renting in the consitution of housing biographies in the United Kingdom', *Journal of Youth Studies*, 7(1), pp. 19-34. Available at: https://doi-org.libproxy.ncl.ac.uk/10.1080/1367626042000209930
- Centres upon the idea of a new student leaving their home environment and moving out
- Useful due to its focus on the operation of economic and housing market constraints
- Constucts typologies of different student renting pathways, of which we are concerned with the **3rd**
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Directly quoting phrases from the article here...
  - 1st pathway= "*chaotic* pathway": limitied planning; absense of family support perhaps due to domestic disputes with parents; left home at early age; limited financial resources so cannot access accomodation in PRS; moves between staying with family members, serial hostel stays, may sleep on street; spatial reach of pathway restricted to particular town/ city
  - 2nd= '*unplanned* pathwaay': no planning; some family support as move supported by family; move is unexpected; limited financial support; may access PRS
  - 3rd= '*constrained* pathway': clear planning; family support; move closer to work; move into PRS; constraints experienced in labour and housing market; potential protracted stay in the parental home because of the lack of available and affordable properties on the owner-occpied market/ PRS; inability to secure reasonably paid, no long-term employment; unable to get mortgage; *steep property price increase are an obstacle for these first-time buyers/ renters*; *geographically bound to a location due to work commitments*
  - ↘️ **This 3rd path is applicable to our project:**
  - **Our project will focus on students who experience constraints in the renting market due to their inability to have long-term employment due to university commitments. These students are moving away from home and struggle to find affordable properties (due to gentrified areas in Newcastle).They may have family support which can be relied upon in times of economic hardship in terms of paying their rent**
  - 4th= '*planned non-student* pathway': substantial planning; few/ managable constraints; delayed leaving of parental home due to limited economic resources/ family formation; could by property with a partner on city outskirts; geographic boundaries limited

## Student Tenant Grassroot Campaigns:
<h2>https://theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2022/08/residents-continue-their-campaign-against-student-housing-on-eyre-place-lane/</h2>
<h3>This is a grassroot campaign of the local residents against the property developers</h3>
This report describes how even though some local residents objected to the property developer： Eyre Place Lane building a student accommodation block on the site, the developer went ahead with plans to build student accommodation.
<br>

Residents were concerned that the scale of the student accommodation was inappropriate for the site, that it would block sunlight and cast shadows on the community garden, and that student parties and terraces would have a negative impact on the neighbourhood. In addition, they questioned whether the developer had exceeded the boundaries of their proposed land ownership. As a result, they coordinated their opposition through the formation of a special interest group and the site. The result was criticism from local officials that it was not in the best interests of the community or the students. However, the end result was that the developers decided to go ahead with their plans for purpose-built student accommodation.
<br>

<h2>https://www.nusconnect.org.uk/campaigns/liber8-education/affordable-housing-for-all</h2>
<h3>This is a grassroot campaign hold by the national union of students</h3>
The problem is this: in the face of rising student accommodation costs without any increase in their own financial means, the proportion of private halls of residence has increased so that students are living in poorer quality but costly halls of residence. 
<br>

They are working with Acorn and Generation to create a UK-wide tenants' union to provide resources and tools to help students improve their housing. In addition, they will advise students living in private halls of residence on their rights.
<br>

They called on activists to be able to think about and consider linking up with other local housing campaigns to hold unscrupulous landlords and extortion agents accountable. Start by setting up a rental network to organise affordable halls of residence on campus.

<h3>This is a grassroot campaign held by Cardiff's Students Union</h3>
This grassroots movement is concerned about the crisis caused by the student housing shortage and wants to make a difference.
<br>

They are now gathering information on the housing experiences of Cardiff University students and conducting a university-wide research project through interviews and focus groups.
<br>

<br>
Their long term plan is to make the Housing Action group an effective long term group at Cardiff and are looking for first and second year students to take over the committee next year.

<h2>https://www.nus.org.uk/cost-of-living</h2>
<h3>This is a grassroot campaign hold by National Union of Students</h3>
The National Union of Students is calling on the next government to end the student cost of living crisis within the first 100 days. This is because they are now living on the UK minimum wage after paying their rent.
<br>

<h2>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/18/rent-rebels-the-tenants-who-fought-for-their-rights-and-won</h2>
<h3>This is a grassroot campaign by tenants in London</h3>
1.	During the COVID-9 period, some tenants working on a freelance basis asked their landlords to be able to reduce their rents by 20 per cent because they could not afford to pay them, but this was considered to be unreasonable behaviour by the housing agency called Tower Quay, and they refused to negotiate with the tenancy associations. The landlord (housing agency) said that it was not impossible to offer all the concessions that the tenants had, but the government did not provide any support to the landlord.
<br>

2.	The dispute didn't stop there. Two tenants, facing eviction for not renewing their tenancies on time, took their landlord: Simpson House 3 Ltd, to court. They argued that the landlord had failed to obtain a house of multiple occupancy (HMO) licence. The result? The landlord settled out of court, acknowledging the tenants' rights. As a result, the tenants were compensated with 70% of their rent and were allowed to continue living in their flats.

<h2>https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/blogs/why-uk-students-are-protesting-against-private-accommodation-providers</h2>
<br>

This report focuses on student protests against private accommodation providers in the UK, and the reasons for them
<br>

1. Accommodation cost issues: Student accommodation is now a £43bn industry with an annual turnover of £5.1bn. Private accommodation providers typically charge more than the national average rent of £147 per week, with many rooms renting for even more than £300 per week. And this high cost of accommodation undoubtedly exacerbates the financial pressures caused by the huge debts that students accumulate in their pursuit of higher education.
<br>

2. The Protest: Students have begun to take militant action to reclaim their accommodation, with the rent strike movement quickly spreading from university-managed halls of residence to the private sector. These actions were in response to the university management's continuous increase in halls of residence rents, with the national average annual rent now easily more than half of the maximum student loan.
<br>

## Key debates surrounding student renting:
<h2>https://news.sky.com/story/student-rent-strike-campaigns-gathering-pace-against-exploitation-10581250</h2>
<br> 

This debate in this website is based on a <b>rent dispute</b> between students at Goldsmiths University of London and the company Campus Living Villages (CLV)
<br> 

<h3>Stance of the tenants living in Raymont Hall, Goldsmiths University of London</h3>
<br> 

1. Shannon Howard and other Goldsmiths undergraduates expressed their frustration with high rents by refusing to pay rent to the Campus Living Villages (CLV), a private company that upkeeps Raymont Hall.
<br>

3. Students organised a two-day workshop aimed at developing strategies for running a successful rent strike campaign on campuses across the UK.
<br>

5. Shannon Howard said that her involvement in the rent strike was not just about rent, but about principle, and that she believed that people's welfare should be prioritised over profit.
<br>

<h3>Stance of the landlord-Campus Living Villages (CLV)</h3>
<br> 

1. CLV demanded by letter, email and voicemail that Miss Shannon Howard need to pay the outstanding rent totalling £1,471.24.
<br>

2. CLV says that if a student is officially registered as a rent striker by the university, then they will not receive a rent recovery letter.
<br>

3. George Spencer, CEO of CLV, said that the rents are "much lower level than they are in the private sector." And he added  "These are students who are unwilling to pay their rent, not unable to pay their rent. If they were unable to pay their rent then the market would correct itself, and we'd see more affordable accommodation built."
<br>

<h3>Goldsmiths University of London's role as a moderator</h3>
"We use a six figure grant to subsidise rents and offer a range of prices to meet all budgets... for this academic year we've frozen prices on more than 100 of our cheapest rooms while there is a below-inflation rise for a further 400 rooms."
<br>

<br>

<h4>The argument is mainly between the tenants (students) and the privately contracted accommodation providers on both sides, with the tenants arguing that the landlord should put people's welfare above their interests, even though Goldsmiths University of London helped to moderate this one thing for them. Private contractors, on the other hand, argued that although house prices had indeed risen, based on the reasoning that the market would self-correct, they felt that it was unlikely that students would be unable to pay their rent at all.</h4>

<br>

## ↪️ From this debates research, these are the key problems students face when renting: 
⚠️⚠️⚠️
- The renting market: high rents in student accomodation/ halls of resdience and private properties. This becomes a form of extortion in the sense that renting prices increase without student renters' financial means increasing simultaneously.
- Students are left living in poor quality but costly halls of residence/ properties as a result
- Lack of affordable properties as the market is currently bolsters short-term tenancy approaches with high rents
- Landlords placing there own interests above student welfare
