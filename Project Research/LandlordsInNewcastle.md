- Students experience maintenance problems with the property itself ie. undone repairs, mould, pest, silverfish
- Landlords making more money off the back of rent price increases which most heavily implicate students for who it is a necessity to rent in the area
- Cheapest rent in the UK is Newcastle however this does not prevent landlords not solving maintenance issues
