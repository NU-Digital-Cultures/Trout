1. Be aware if the landlord owns an House in Multiple Occupation (HMO)
<br> 

2. Be aware that the landlord is required by law to install at least one smoke alarm and fire extinguisher on each floor, and a carbon monoxide detector where there is a combustion furnace
<br>

4. The landlord can only enter your property in the event of an emergency, e.g. fire, burglary, etc. Otherwise the landlord can only enter the property with 24 hours' notice.

- Sinks, baths and toilets
- Pipes and wiring
- Heating and hot water (including the boiler)

5. There are a number of reasons why a landlord could legally evict you, including the following:

- Being regularly late with your payments
- Breaching any of the terms of your tenancy agreement
- Letting the property fall into an unacceptable state
- Subletting a room without permission
- Causing serious nuisance to the neighbours

- Reporting repairs and damage to items in the property asap. Always report any damage or repair requests in writing, even if your landlord has stated for you just to ring. In the writing, stipulate the date you made the request and keep a copy incase there is need to dispute in future
- If the landlord refuses your request for repairs, do not withold your rent as this would place you at risk of losing your home

- Newcastle City Council's Public Protecton and Neighbourhoods Team can help enforce repairs (0191 2787878)
- Enabling your landlord/ letting agent reasonable access to the property for repairs and inspections
- At the start of an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, if you paid your landlord a deposit, your landlord has an obligation to protect this in one of the tree government approved schemes. If your landlord has not protected your deposit, ask them to or ask them to tell you where it has been protected. For deposit protection issues see: https://www.privaterentedservice.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Guide-Deposit-protection-TNT-001.pdf (**we could create a guide like this but in different format and easier to understand**).

**Evaluation**: These could be useful to include, we just need to make sure they are related to common problems in renting rather than just stipulating 'facts' that are not necessarily points of contention
