Note for **Soi**: Relate the elements of the house to outlining tenant and landlord rights/ responsibilities. 
<br>

Idea of an effective 'walkthrough of rights and responsibilities', done better than gov/ charity/ social organisation websites etc.
<br>

- **Tenant Deposit**: If you are entering an [assured shorthold tenancy](https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/tenancy-types), your landlord has an obligation to protect your deposit through one of the approved UK Government schemes. This is called Tenancy Deposit Protection (TDP). In Newcastle, Deposit Protection is enforced by the [Deposit Protection Service](https://www.depositprotection.com/), [MyDeposits](https://www.mydeposits.co.uk/), and the [Tenancy Deposit Scheme](https://www.tenancydepositscheme.com/). Your landlord or letting agent have a responsibility to protect your deposit through one of these schemes within 30 days of receving your deposit. These schemes are important for ensuring tenants have their deposit returned at the end of their tenancy, so long as there is no damage to the property, rent and bills are paid on time, and the tenant has met the terms of the tenancy agreement. Deposits must be returned to tenants within 10 days from the point at which the returned deposit amount was agreed between the tenant and landlord/ letting agent. If you, as tenant, do not agree with the returned amount, the TDP scheme you are in offers a free resolution service where you can raise a dispute. So long as you and your landlord/ letting agent agree to use a TDP resolution service decision, the TDP decision is absolute. However, if this is not the case, you can raise a dispute through the [First-Fier Tribunal](https://www.judiciary.uk/courts-and-tribunals/tribunals/first-tier-tribunal/property-chamber/) if you believe your landlord/ letting agent is unfairly witholding the full deposit amount. Alternatively, so long as you have created a complaint with your landlord/ letting agent already, you can go to an Obudsman. To dispute with a landlord, seek support from the [Housing Ombudsman Service](https://www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk/). To dispute with a property agent, seek support from the [Property Ombudsman](https://www.tpos.co.uk/) and the [Property Redress Scheme](https://www.theprs.co.uk/Consumer).
- Then this leads to the figures below: ⬇️
- Some kind of image representing the First-Fier Tribunal and a figure representing Ombudsmen?: **Grounds for raising a Dispute**: A dispute on behalf of yourself, the tenant, can be made through the First-Fier Tribunal so long as you occupy a Residential Property (a Property designed to be lived in). Disputes can be made if your landlord/ letting agent attempts to implicate upon you unfair charges or service fees, charges for references, credit checks, administrations, or check-ins, or if they want to increase your rent during your fixed-term tenancy period.  If the latter is the case, you can only apply to the tribunal if you are in an [assured or assured shorthold tenancy](https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/tenancy-types), your rent increase has been implicated a 'section 13 procedure', and you must apply before the increased rent payments are due to begin. The notice of increase you should receive from your landlord regarding these changes will outline whether the changes are part of a 'section 13 procedure', that is, the rent is being increased for a contractual periodic tenancy that contains a rent review clause.
- Front door: **Visitations**: Tenants must respond reasonably to landlord/ letting agents' requests to entering your property. This includes allowing third parties to enter the property for the purposes of maintenance and repairs. However, the tenant should be provided with 24 hours notice before any other persons enters the property.
- **Paying your Rent**: Rent payments must be made in full and on time. If you do not make this requirement, you are in what is called 'rent arrears' and this means that you could face eviction from the property. If you are in 'rent arrears', your landlord must give you two weeks notice before they expect you to leave the property. They can only do this if you are in an [assured shorthold tenancy or assured tenancy](https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/tenancy-types) and they must use the 'section 8' notice to evict you. If you do not leave the property within two weeks, your landlord can take your [eviction to court](https://www.gov.uk/private-renting-evictions/eviction-court-hearings). The court will undoubtedly approve your eviction if you are in the following rent arrears: you pay rent monthly and it is 2 months late, or, you pay rent weekly and it is 8 weeks late. If this is not the case for you, the court may disapprove of your eviction. This outcome would state that your eviction is not unreasonable and permit you to stay in your property so long as you pay your landlord the full amount you owe them by a specific date and so long as you do not fall into rent arrears again. If you are struggling to make your rent payments, you can consult a debt advisor service which can help you manage and budget your rent repayments, such as the following: [Citizens Adice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/), [National Debtline](https://www.nationaldebtline.org/), [Community Money Advice](https://www.communitymoneyadvice.com/freedom-from-debt/get-help), [StepChange Debt Charity](https://www.stepchange.org/contact-us.aspx), the [Debt Advice Foundation](https://www.debtadvicefoundation.org/), or [Money Wellness](https://www.moneywellness.com/). Alternatively, you can see support and advice from the charity [Shelter](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/eviction/how_to_deal_with_rent_arrears). If you are in urgent need of financial support, you can apply for Discretionary Housing Payments (DHPs) from your local council to help you pay your rent or find out if you are eligible to apply for [universal credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/eligibility). Universal credit accounts for those struggling to pay their rent.
- **Eviction**: At present, your landlord can evict you from the property without reason. This is permitted only through the 'section 21' notice. You must be provided with a two month period to move out. After this period, if you have not left the property, your landlord can take your [eviction to court](https://www.gov.uk/private-renting-evictions/eviction-court-hearings). The Renters Refrom Bill 2022-23 proposed to abolish the 'section 21' notice, effectively banning no-fault evictions. However, this did not successfully make it through Pariliament and has not been passed.
- **Cost of Rent**: To find out the cost of your rent and when reviews to your rent amount will be made, you should consult your tenancy agreement. Your landlord cannot impose an increased rent cost if you are in a fixed-term tenancy (where a tenancy agreement has been signed stipulating that the rent will occur for a set period) unless you, as tenant, agree with the changes. If you do not agree with the rent increase, it can only be implemented by the landlord after you fixed-term tenancy has ended. Landlords can only increase rent without your consultation if you have a periodic tenancy (occuring on a week-to-week or month-to-month basis). However, landlords can only increase your rent without your agreement once a year. Any rent increases should be 'fair' in that they are in line with other local rent prices and they must be in line with market rates. You should check whether your tenancy agreement has a Rent Review clause which would stipulate when your rent can go up, by how much, and notice required of the rent increase. If you have just started a tenancy and you feel the rent is too high, you may be able to apply to the tribunal. It is best to contact [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) first so that they can advise your on your situation.
- **Tenant Liable Charges**: As tenant, you will be charged your rent; a refundable holding deposit to reserve your property (capped at no more than one week's rent); any reasonable (what the landlord would have lost out on) loss costs for the landlord/ letting agency (in terms of advertising the property etc) if you decide to cut your tenancy short (early termination fees); tenancy amendment payments (such as swapping tenants) which is capped at £50; utility bills; TV License, Council Tax; late payment of rent fees (only if the payment is late of 14 days and interest added should be capped at 3% above Bank of Endland base rates; fees for lost keys/ security devices which permit access to the property (you should only be charged what it cost the landlord/ letting agent to replace these)
- **Unjust Tenant Charges**: Maintenance, repairs, or service charges (for cleaning services etc). Fees for credit checks, references, administrations, check-ins, or legal fees. It is illegal for your landlord/ letting agent to charge you anything other than your agreed payments as per your tenancy agreement.
- Computer: **Personal Items**: It is advisible to insure all your personal contents that will be within the property with contents insurance. This can be provided through many insurance companies such as [Compare the Market](https://www.comparethemarket.com/home-insurance/tenants-liability-insurance/?AFFCLIE=IM51&SRC=IM51&cmpid=PC-_-GOG-_-HH-_-GEN-_-Ab7OfYYea5OYABg&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw88yxBhBWEiwA7cm6pem6wBKeGrDLdqkbVEii97V9zpdFzgzi6OGcrpiXIrnwZnlsWBW4aBoCox8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), [Protect Your Bubble](https://www.protectyourbubble.com/renters-insurance?agg30=PPC_Rent_Google_HVGen_Renters&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw88yxBhBWEiwA7cm6pfi68tNFMp5Z4o5UsP3t4ag-ppKlbEq8KdZPv6mdE93IKi6Ntif8RxoCdpcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), or [John Lewis](https://www.johnlewisfinance.com/insurance/home-insurance/contents-cover.html?ppc=true&eng=GOOGLE&product=Home&cat=generic&camp=JLF_HOM_GA_GEN_CONTENTS+BROAD&track=DS&keyword=uk+home+contents+insurance&adgroup=Home+Ins_Contents_UK&utm_source=search&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw88yxBhBWEiwA7cm6pZv3yIjYZeANztK8-eX9QKL0qSFyXeVhAXBzeKTMbf4456sy6q7sxRoCrp0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).
- Showerhead: **Utilities**: It is the tenant's responsibility to set up utilities for the property if utilities are not included in rent payments. UniHomes offers for students but of course you can choose a different utilities provider. Currently, there is not many 'money saving' options by choosing a differnt provided. If your rent includes utility bills, your landlord may potentially increase your rent if your usage exceeds . You do not have to agree to the increased rent amount. However, your landlord may use a 'section 21' notice which could leave you facing a no-fault eviction. It is best to negotiate with your landlord as it is often harder for them to find a new tenant willing to pay the higher rent. Your landlord cannot charge you any more than what they are themselves being charged by the utility provider. Be aware of the fact that if you pay the increased rent amount, eventhough you do not agree with it, this would legally become your new rent. 
- Oven: **Repair of Items**: If there is any faults with the items in your property, you should inform your landlord/ letting agent as soon as possible. The landlord must respond to your repair request within a reasonable time frame. There is no legal definition of a reasonable time frame, however the response time should be proportional to the seriousness of the matter if the repair was not to be made. If you are a vulnerable tenant, that is, you have health issues, mobility problems, or there is children or elders living in the property, then you can request a time period to your landlord/ letting agent for the repairs to be made. Repairs that would pose serious safety risks if not resolved (ie. water leaking from pipes, problems with electrics, wiring, or drains) should be treated as an emergency. 
- Lightbulb: **Property Maintenance and Repairs**: A tenant is responsible for the general upkeep of the property, keeping inside and any outside areas to a reasonable standard. You are responsible for keeping the property ventilated to help prevent mould/ condensation and changing light bulbs in light fixtures or batteries in smoke alarms. However, crucially, you are not responsible for the natural wear and tear of a property and it is expected that the state of the property will not be exactly the same as when you first started your tenancy. The landlord is responsible for electrical wiring, boiler maintenance, gas pipes, ventilation, chimneys, bathroom fixtures (shower, sink, bath, and toilet), plumbing and drain maintenance, internal/ external walls, stairs, bannisters, doors, windows, and rooves. Your landlord may claim diminished responsibility for these items, however, even if it is not sttipulated in your tenancy agreement, they are still responsible for them as per 'section 11 repairs' of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.
- Cupboard next to the stairs: **Meter Readings** If your name is on your utilities bill, not your landlords, and you are responsible for paying utility bills separate to your rent, then you should submit meter readings when asked to do so by your energy provider. This is to ensure you are charged correctly for your usage. If a meter measures only your usage, then your landlord must use this to work out your charge. However, if one meter accounts for the usage of multiple tenants, it is your landlords responsibility to implement a fair process of working out how much each tenant should pay and this must be explained to you upon request If your landlord proposes a rent increases on the basis of increased utility charges, such increase should be for the exact amount they would be charged by the utility provider.
- Fridge: **Proof of Damage**: It is recommended to take photos inside your rented property and the items within in it. These can be used as your evidence in rent deposit return disputes if the landlord falsely claims there has been damage caused to items within the property by you during your tenancy.
- Overhead of the oven: **Safety Checks**: Your landlord is responsible for following gas, fire, and electricity safety rules. This includes conducting safety checks via an electrician every 5 years and keeping safety certificates updated on electricals. An electrician should check wiring, plug sockets, light fittings, fuse boxes, electric showers, and extractor fans. The electrician's report should be given to you and your landlord. However, you as tenant are responsible for reporting any safety issues as soon as possible, ensuring your own electrical devices meet safety requirements, and permitting electricians/ other required officials reasonable access to the property. Your landlord/ letting agent is required to give you 24 hours notice of a third-party entering your property.
- Laptop: **Contacting your landlord**: If you are contacting your landlord/ letting afent to report an issue with or within the property, use clear and precise language that clearly stipulates the issue you are facing at hand and the consequences that will be implicated upon you or your health if they are not resolved urgently. This is good evidence to have if any unresolved issues amount to a dispute between you and your landlord.
