  root((Relevant theories, concepts, and perspectives of Gentrification))
    **An increased understanding of these theories will help us frame our project**
    Diappi and Bolchi's definition of Gentrification - 2006
      "a spontaneous process of revitalisation and redevelopment of a central neightbourhood, which provokes a rise in residential property price and hence a population turn-over in favour of middle-upper classes." p.6
           The "physical upward changes concern old lower class neighbourhoods and industrial districts."
         The "rising quality of buildings and urban surroundings results in a social shift, attracting people who are younger, cultured and affluent enough to pay continually increasing prices."
           Students can oftentimes be relied upon to pay such increases as they can short-term borrow from parents/ family and use student loans. Yet, this does not undermine the fact that they are being exploited and can suffer exploitative landlord practices
             Relation to poor and unethical landlord practices
     Gentrification phenomenon does not occur piecemeal- it "affects whole urban districts" and results from "many individual decisions interacting and cooperating for mutual advantage" p.6-7
     What is the mechanism behind gentrification? p.7
           2 approaches: "cultural phenomenon driven by demand" adopted by urban geographer and sociologist perspectives- a "return of middle socio-econmic classes" from isolated housing in the suburbs to lively city, or, "new middle glass emerging in the transition from industrial to post-industrial city"
    **Rent Gap Theory** by Marxist economist, Smith - 1979
        Adopts supply approach of gentrification driven by demand. "It is capital, given appropriate conditions, which finds it  worth  investing in decayed urban areas, due to the potential gains from substantial increases is land rent and land value; population turnover represents a physiological consequence of the process." Idea that there is a life cycle to a building and once it decays it needs revitalisation via reinvestment- Diapi and Bolchi, 2006, p.7
       The Gap Theory= gap created between the current and expected rent after rehabilitation- Diapi and Bolchi, 2006, p.6-7
          This idea of rent value based off practical/ impractical land use has been debated eg. Bourassa argues rent has a value based off the land's highest and best use, not poor use to good use- 1933
            This idea critqiued by Clark, stating rent can be affected by land use- 1995
              Clark successfully tested Smith's RGT - 1987
       Smith's conceptualisation differs to other economists. Smith's property investment/ disinvestment cycle in relation to rent dynamic of the building- explained by Diapi and Bolchi, 2006, p.8
        1st stage: "new construction and first cycle of use"- property deteriorates at hand of the homeowner or tenant
        2nd stage: "from homeowner to landlord"- when a property is let, the criteria for investing in maintenance change, and investment is only worthwhile if there is return in terms of rent
        3rd stage: as the rent of the property is determined by conditions of surrounding buildings, you get decay of whole neighbourhood. 
        4th stage: less investment in that area, more investment in more profitable areas. Rents and house values collapse, producing falls in property prices. Vandalism and crime accelerate process of degradation
        5th stage: property abandoned. The rent collapse "creates the economic conditions for a rational market response: revaluation of the area through investment and consequent triggering of gentrification"
        This relates to Newcastle's 'post-industrial' town status
          Coincides with Smith's definitions: - Smith, 1979, p.543
            Capitalised ground rent is "the actual quantity of ground rent that is appropriated by the land owner, given the present land use." This includes landlord's service on the land that they own, so production of the land and ownership of the land are combined. This rent is paid by the tenant
            Potential ground rent as "the amount that could be capitalized under the land's "highest and best use."" Due to location, usually, an area can "capitalize higher quantities of ground rent under a differnt land use"
            Ground rent is "the claim made by landowners on users of their land; it represents the surplus value created over and above cost-price by producers on the site"
            There is a graph on p.544 showcasing the RGT
     RGT still holds strong today
    **Cultural Commodification theory** as a way of understanding gentrification's social, cultural, and political dimensions
      Focusses upon showcasing how the culture of a neighbourhood, such as its history, architecture, artistic and infrastructrual character, are commodified, aestheticised, and exploited for economic gain during gentrification processes
        Ties to NE1 redevelopment inititatives in Newcastle
      Idea that culture unique to a community that have developed organically over time are valuable marketable commodities. Eg. historic buildings, local arts scenes, distinct local cuisines. Idea of creating a unique urban experience
        Gentrification has become "a major component of the urban imaginary" Ley, 2003, p.2527
        Analogy of "it is not Manchester that needs Selfridges, but Selfridges that needs Manchester." Incorporates Bourdieu's economic and cultrual capital to the inner-city land market. Ley, 2003, p.2528
          Idea of that the "aesthetic disposition that transforms ordinary materials into valued objects." Ley, 2003, p.2530. As Boudieu puts it, in "a  styllisation of life nothing is more distinctive, more distinguished, than the capacity to confer aesthetic status on objects that are banal or even 'common.'" So, the idea that economic capital can be achieved by inscribing an object with cultural capital. 1984, p.12. So that "Cultural consecretation does indeed confer on the objects, persons and situations that it touches a sort of ontological promotion akin to a transubstantiation." So the area of Newcastle gains economic value when its culture is aestheticised, and this aestheticisation is a key part of gentrification. Newcastle's valuable cultural production is ascribed onto new buildings and gentrifications' creations as the optimal site of value creation. 1984, p.6
          Could be argued that artists are exploited as they engage in cultural production which results in value creation, which is exploited for others' economic gains, and then they cannot afford to live in the newly culturally-ascribed areas/ have low economic capital themselves
          Same for students? They revive the city/ contribute to it but cannot afford to live in it
             Conceptualise the relations between actors in our project in terms of who has capital and of what types?
