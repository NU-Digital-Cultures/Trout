# The Tenant Talk identity 📖🧑‍🤝‍🧑

Digital storytelling ➡️ Foucault's 'technologies of the self' ➡️  tenant identity, community, and vernacular formation
<br>

## Identity and Community formation
### McKinlay, A. and Starkey, K. P. (1997) *Foucault, management and organization theory from panopticon to technologies of the self*. London: Sage Publications.
- Foucault contributes to social theory through producing ways of deconstructing what it means to be a modern subject
- Individuals and groups define themselves through 'technologies of the self'
- "Through these practices, individuals and groups embody forms of action that 'free' themselves from what they consider intolerable in their current situation and thus define their own limits." - p.214
- This theory works well with the fact we are providing a **self-dictated digital space** for tenants whereby they can subvert and dictate new ways of producing power dynamics in relation to their current renting situations (critique of their landlord, critique of gentrification etc.)
- Our technologies will set new boundaries of self-discipline and self-knowing from which a collective 'tenant identity' can form

### Foucault, M (1988) 'Technologies of the self', in L. H. Martin, H. Gutman and P. Huton (eds), *Technologies of the Self: A Seminar with Michael Foucault.* London: Tavistock, pp. 16-49.
- Idea of fostering a new ontology onto ourselves via ethical practices. These practices have "the neccessity of excavating our own culture in order to open a free space for innovation and creativity" - p.163
- Tenant submissions will be creative
- Our app should provide an alternative avenue for tenants whereby they are permitted to innovatively storytell their struggles. The idea of providing a platform which provides a space for tenants to reconsider and redefine their struggles on their own terms allows them to 'claim back' (ethical) power within their specific situations
- Tenants enacting this in mass will lead to a certain level of consciousness shared among users, in other words, leading to a collective 'tenant identity' production

## Vernacular formation
### Baldick, C. (2008) The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms. Available at: https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780199208272.001.0001/acref-9780199208272-e-1200 (Accessed: 3 May 2024).
- Vernacular= "The local language or dialect of common speech"
- However, **internet/ digital communities** also have vernaculars
- Through use of Tenant Talk, which permits **interaction with fellow student tenants**, we can aim for a 'tenant vernacular' sort-of-speak to form (ie. on discussions of similar issues/ shared experience and specific student renting terminology)
