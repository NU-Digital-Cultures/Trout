# Our 'Tenant Handbook' section of our app
## This file looks at existing services that have a similar agenda to our 'handbook'/ tenant guide idea, evaluates them, and forms ideas for our own handbook based off these evaluations
Based on the stories we received from survey participants, a 'handbook' feature would be useful in empowering tenants (which is HtN's aim) with the knowledge and tools to demand safe, secure, well-kept, and professionally managed homes to live in

-	**Evaluation**: very useful in terms of the way quite a large volume of information is categorised and follows a logical progression. Relatively easy to navigate, however, a lot of the links lead to the same/ similar information so if we were to adopt this approach, **it could be better if we don’t include repetitive information. Keep it clear, simple, and informative. Also, because we are trying to achieve an approach that is unconventional/ supports tenants in new ways, we could lay out our information handbook differently. This could include maybe tying this information into our aim of forming a ‘tenant identity’- could maybe have an image of some sort and then click on different aspects of the image to delve deeper into the topic** ⚠️
- Guide to renting section includes short video clips about the renting process. This section is very effective as it moves through outlining tenants’ and landlords’ ‘Rights and Responsibilities’, ‘Moving in’, ‘Being a good tenant’, ‘Problem neighbours’, ‘Moving on.’ Includes basic visuals in the video and text related to the visuals. **Perhaps we could have our image as the image of a home and then the user clicks onto different aspects of the property to learn about the renting experience ie. If want to learn about electrical safety/ maintenance, you would click on that item eg. A lightbulb** ⚠️
- Tenants library includes answers to commonly asked questions
-	**Evaluation**: these sections are more confusing in that they overlap more in content ie. The same sections feature/ are repeaated in other sections, so it does not follow a strictly logical path and it is easy to get lost

## Based on this research, our app 'handbook' could look and function like this:
