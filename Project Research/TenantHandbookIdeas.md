# Our 'Tenant Handbook' section of our app
## This file looks at existing services that have a similar agenda to our 'handbook'/ tenant guide idea, evaluates them, and forms ideas for our own handbook based off these evaluations
Based on the stories we received from survey participants, a 'handbook' feature would be useful in empowering tenants (which is HtN's aim) with the knowledge and tools to demand safe, secure, well-kept, and professionally managed homes to live in

-	**Evaluation**: very useful in terms of the way quite a large volume of information is categorised and follows a logical progression. Relatively easy to navigate, however, a lot of the links lead to the same/ similar information so if we were to adopt this approach, **it could be better if we don’t include repetitive information. Keep it clear, simple, and informative. Also, because we are trying to achieve an approach that is unconventional/ supports tenants in new ways, we could lay out our information handbook differently. This could include maybe tying this information into our aim of forming a ‘tenant identity’- could maybe have an image of some sort and then click on different aspects of the image to delve deeper into the topic** ⚠️
- Guide to renting section includes short video clips about the renting process. This section is very effective as it moves through outlining tenants’ and landlords’ ‘Rights and Responsibilities’, ‘Moving in’, ‘Being a good tenant’, ‘Problem neighbours’, ‘Moving on.’ Includes basic visuals in the video and text related to the visuals. **Perhaps we could have our image as the image of a home and then the user clicks onto different aspects of the property to learn about the renting experience ie. If want to learn about electrical safety/ maintenance, you would click on that item eg. A lightbulb** ⚠️
- Tenants library includes answers to commonly asked questions
-	**Evaluation**: these sections are more confusing in that they overlap more in content ie. The same sections feature/ are repeaated in other sections, so it does not follow a strictly logical path and it is easy to get lost
<br>

- Provides advice to tenants taking on new tenancies
- Outlines differences between renting from a landlord compared to a letting agency
- Stipulates things tenants should check and look out for when starting their tenancy eg. learning about their rent payments/ checking Energy Performance Certificates
- The last section is quite unique and could be **very effective for our approach of creating a tenant identity** with our zine aesthetic. This section outlines key factors that tenants should look out for which would be classed as discrimination. It actually outright states these things are discrimination- **we should do the same** as we are adopting a strong advocacy approach
  <br>

## Based on this research, our app 'handbook' could look and function like this:

- This idea has been agreed on as a group
- When users click onto different visual aspects/ objects of the house, a pop up will appear informing them of their tenant responsibilities and rights related to that object
- We decided that this overcomes the difficulty that government websites implement, whereby they have loads of sections with information which feels like an overwhelming 'information dump'
- This is a way of achieving the empowerment of tenants with the tools and knowledge of navigating their renting process that is basic and more effective
<br>

## Content of the Handbook
Relate the elements of the house to outlining tenant and landlord rights/ responsibilities:
<br>

- Staircase: Deposit: "If you are entering an assured shorthold tenancy, your landlord has an obligation to protect your deposit through one of the approved UK Government schemes. This is called Tenancy Deposit Protection (TDP). In Newcastle, Deposit Protection is enforced by the Deposit Protection Service, MyDeposits, and The Tenancy Deposit Scheme. Your landlord or letting agent have a responsibility to protect your deposit through one of these schemes within 30 days of receving your deposit. These schemes are important for ensuring tenants have their deposit returned at the end of their tenancy, so long as there is no damage to the property, rent and bills are paid on time, and the tenant has met the terms of the tenancy agreement
